The attention mask and the pad token id were not set. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.
Setting `pad_token_id` to `eos_token_id`:128001 for open-end generation.
The attention mask is not set and cannot be inferred from input because pad token is same as eos token. As a consequence, you may observe unexpected behavior. Please pass your input's `attention_mask` to obtain reliable results.

Prediction: None
Full Response: You are given a patient's social history text. Your task is to analyze the text and determine the status of the patient's **alcohol use**. You need to return a json file.

For each text provided, you must generate and can only generate two lines, the first line should only contain one of possible la ...
