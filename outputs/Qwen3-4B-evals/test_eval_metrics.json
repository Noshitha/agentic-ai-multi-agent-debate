However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether she's currently in rehab or if it's a past episode.

The patient mentions \"rare ETOH,\" which suggests they use alcohol occasionally. However, they also state \"no tobacco- quit 40 years ago.\" The key here is \"rare ETOH,\" indicating minimal or infrequent use. But since they haven't specified that they've quit using alcohol, and the phrase \"rare\" might imply past use, but the text doesn't clearly state if they currently use it. However, the mention of \"quit 40 years ago\" refers to tobacco, not alcohol. So, without explicit info on current use, but with \"rare\" suggesting past use, it's ambiguous. But since they don't mention quitting alcohol, maybe it's present? Wait, but \"rare\" might mean they don't use it much. Hmm. Alternatively, \"rare ETOH\" could mean they have a rare habit, but not sure. The key is that the text doesn't say they currently use it. So maybe \"Past\" since they used it in the past but not currently. But the term \"rare\" is unclear. Alternatively, \"None\" if they don't use it at all. But the term \"rare\" might"

The lungs were\nclear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was\ntympanitic and distended, mildly tender in the right upper\nquadrant, with no rebound or guarding.  Extremity examination\nrevealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic\nexamination was grossly nonfocal.  Cranial nerves II through\nXII were intact.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The\npatient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.\n\n1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient was\ntransfused multiple units of packed red blood cells and fresh\nfrozen plasma.  The patient's Coumadin was held.  His INR was\n2.5 on admission.  The patient was given intravenous vitamin\nK and intravenous Protonix q.12h. and was made nothing by\nmouth.\n\nAn esophagogastroduodenoscopy done showed reflux from the\nduodenum/tumor area, but the scope could not be passed into\nthe duodenum secondary to tumor.  A nasogastric lavage was\nrepeated which showed coffee-grounds followed by fresh clots\nof red blood.\n\nThe patient was sent to Interventional Radiology for an\nangioembolization.  An angioembolization was done to the\ngastroduodenal artery on [**7-25**].  This procedure was\ncomplicated with a right groin hematoma.\n\nOn [**7-26**], the patient's hematocrit was still slowly\ndropping.  Interventional Radiology and Surgery were\nconsulted again.  The patient was sent for a repeat\nembolization on [**7-28**].  This embolization was\ncomplicated with a left groin hematoma and pseudoaneurysm.\n\nFollowing the second angioembolization, the patient's\nhematocrit remained stable for 24 hours, and he was\ntransferred to the medicine floor from the unit.  The patient\nreceived a total of 14 units of packed red blood cells and 10\nunits of fresh frozen plasma in the unit.  On [**7-30**],\nthe patient had a prominent injection into the left femoral\npseudoaneurysm.\n\nOn [**7-31**], the patient had an ultrasound which showed a\npseudoaneurysm still present in the left femoral area with\nflow through it.  His hematocrit was stable at that time.\n\nOn [**8-1**], the day following the patient being\ntransferred to the floor, his hematocrit was dropping slowly\nto 28 with an expanding left femoral hematoma.  The patient\nreceived 2 units of packed red blood cells, and 2 units of\nfresh frozen plasma, and 1 mg of intravenous vitamin K.\n\nVascular Surgery was consulted again, and the patient was to\ngo for repair of the left femoral pseudoaneurysm.  The\npatient's hematocrit was stable for the next three days at\napproximately 32.  His INR was corrected to 1.3.\n\nOn [**8-3**], the patient was taken to the operating room\nfor pseudoaneurysm repair.  On [**8-4**], the patient was\nfound to still have a slowly dropping hematocrit once again.\nHe was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.  A\nrepeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**8-5**]\nwhich was negative.  The patient's hematocrit remained stable\nat approximately 30 until discharge.\n\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was ventricularly\npaced, and therefore ischemia was unable to be evaluated\nbased on his electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department.\nThe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and his\nantihypertensive medications were held.  The patient's blood\npressure remained stable throughout his hospitalization.\n\n3.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of\nchronic constipation.  The patient was placed on a bowel\nregimen which included Senna and docusate.  The patient was\nalso placed on simethicone for complaints of bloating.  The\npatient had regular bowel movements after being transferred\nto the floor and did not have any further gastrointestinal\ncomplaints.  The patient was also started on Viokase with\nmeals for possible pancreatic dysfunction.\n\n4.  COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient was initially admitted\non Coumadin with an INR of 2.5 following reversal of\nanticoagulation with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K  while\nthe patient was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Once the\npatient was transferred to the floor, his INR continued to\nincrease to a maximum level of 2.9.  The patient again\nreceived 2 more units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 mg of\nintravenous vitamin K while on the floor and then placed on\noral vitamin K to maintain his INR at less than 1.5.  The\npatient was discharged with an INR of 1.3 which remained\nstable following the initial reversal with fresh frozen\nplasma and vitamin K.\n\n5.  PSEUDOANEURYSM ISSUES:  The patient's angioembolization\nprocedures were complicated with bilateral groin hematomas\nand a left groin pseudoaneurysm.  The patient had bilateral\nultrasounds initially done showing no pseudoaneurysm on the\nright, just a hematoma, and a pseudoaneurysm on the left.\nThe patient had a thrombin injection performed and a repeat\nultrasound which showed the pseudoaneurysm was still present\nthat then began to expand with an expanding hematoma and a\ndrop in his hematocrit.

The first sentence says the patient denies tobacco, alcohol, and intravenous drug use. Then, throughout the medical course, there's a lot of details about gastrointestinal issues, coagulopathy, pseudoaneurysm, etc. But I don't see any mention of alcohol use after the initial denial. The patient's alcohol use is only mentioned in the social history as denied. There's no indication that they ever used alcohol, so the label should be None. The reasoning is that the patient explicitly denies it, and there's no subsequent use mentioned. So the answer is None.\nReasoning: The patient explicitly denies alcohol use in the social history, and there is no subsequent mention of alcohol use during the hospital course"

The patient mentions they \"drink ETOH occasionally.\" The term \"occasionally\" suggests that they do consume alcohol, but not regularly. However, the text doesn't specify whether this is current use or past. The phrase \"denies tobacco or IVDU\" might imply they're not using those substances, but it doesn't directly address alcohol. Since there's no mention of stopping alcohol use, and they are described as drinking occasionally, it's more likely they are currently using it.

However, the last part mentions they \"recently at rehab.\" Rehab is typically for overcoming substance abuse, so that suggests they might have had a problem with alcohol in the past. But the key here is the explicit statement \"no EtOH,\" which means they don't use it now. The rehab part could imply past use, but the label options are Present, Past, or None. Since they currently don't use alcohol and the rehab is recent, it's more about past use. Wait, but the label \"Past\" is for no longer using. The text says \"no EtOH,\" so present status is none. But the rehab part might indicate they had a past use. However, the explicit statement \"no EtOH\" would override that. So the correct label is \"None\" because they are not currently using and the rehab is recent, but the text explicitly states no EtOH. Hmm, but the rehab might mean they were using before. Wait,"

Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\nOkay, let's look at the text. The patient's social history mentions \"No tobacco, ETOH use.\" So, ETOH stands for ethanol, which is alcohol. The phrase \"ETOH use\" here is in the present tense, which suggests that the patient is currently using alcohol. However, the rest of the text doesn't provide any information about whether this use is current or past. The mention of living at a facility and being visited by her son might indicate some level of care, but that doesn't directly relate to alcohol use status. Since the text explicitly states \"ETOH use\" without any time frame, it's safest to assume it's current. But wait, sometimes in medical records, \"use\" can be ambiguous. However, given the context and the lack of any indication that it's a past use, the most accurate label here would be Present.\nLabel: Present\n\nReasoning: The text explicitly states \"ETOH use,\" which indicates current alcohol use without any indication of past or non-use. The other details about living arrangements and family do not contradict this finding. \n\nLabel: Present\n\nWait, but I need to be careful. The phrase \"ETOH use\" could be in the present tense, but in medical contexts,"

The patient was admitted on the MUST sepsis\nprotocol.  During his first hospital day, he was hypotensive\nand required both Levophed and vasopressin to keep his mean\narterial pressure greater than 65, his lactic acidosis peaked\nwith a lactate level of 6.0, and he was placed on a\nbicarbonate drip in the setting of both nongap and anion gap\nacidosis.  He also required an insulin drip.  His cortisol\nstimulation test was negative with a baseline cortisol of 100\nin the setting of his sepsis which is an appropriate\nresponse.  His aspiration pneumonia was treated with a 9-day\ncourse of ceftazidime, vancomycin and Flagyl to cover\nnosocomial aspiration.  The vancomycin was switched to\noxacillin after sensitivities came back on a Staph aureus\nthat grew out of his sputum that showed it to be sensitive to\noxacillin.\n\nThe patient improved rapidly after his early intervention in\nsepsis therapy and was weaned off vasopressors by hospital\nday #2.  He completed the remainder of his antibiotic course\nand did not have any further temperature spikes for the\nremainder of his ICU course.\n\n2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient required intubation for\nrespiratory distress in the setting of acute aspiration\npneumonia and pneumonitis, as well as increased respiratory\ndrive from two metabolic acidosis processes.  He was able to\nbe quickly weaned off his ventilator, as his sepsis also\nrapidly improved.  He was extubated on [**2146-12-8**] after some\ndiuresis to remove volume that had been given during his\nacute sepsis.  He remained extubated and has gradually had\nimproving pulmonary toilet over the past few days.  The\npatient is currently on a scoop mask with 12 liters of flow\nand has had stable O2 sats of 95% or greater since then.\n\n3) NEUROLOGIC:  After extubation, it became apparent that Mr.\n[**Known lastname 12574**] had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria,\ndysphagia, and left leg weakness.  A head CT done to rule out\nany acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known\nhemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  His\nneurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the\npast few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved.\nHe has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has\n4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop\nis also improved.  He currently is requiring NG tube for\nfeeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation.\nThe plan will be to reevaluate him on Monday, [**12-19**], to\nsee if his swallowing has improved with his improved\ndysarthria.  He will be continued on an aspirin a day for\nstroke prophylaxis.  It is likely that this stroke occurred\nin the setting of low-flow during his hypotensive episodes.\n\n4) GI BLEEDING:  Upon admission, the patient had guaiac\npositive NG output and stool, although there was no gross\nblood, melena or coffee grounds from this output.  He did\nhave a total of 3 units of packed RBCs during his\nhospitalization with a hematocrit drop from 34 down to 26,\nand 3 units of blood required to get him above 30.  He was\ninitially started on Protonix and sucralfate for presumed\nstress gastritis.  After this intervention, he had no further\nsigns of GI bleeding, and his hematocrit has remained stable\nsince [**2146-12-7**].  He was then changed to lansoprazole\ntherapy only.\n\n5) CHRONIC DIARRHEA:  The patient did not have diarrhea while\nNPO, and his diarrhea restarted in the setting of his tube\nfeeds.  He had no further nausea or vomiting on admission.\nCultures of his stool were negative.  C. difficile x 3 was\nnegative.  Stool Osm gap was also nondiagnostic.  He was seen\nby his outpatient gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12575**], during this\nhospitalization who feels that he will perform a flexible\nsigmoidoscopy when his respiratory status is improved.  We\nwill currently continue Pepto-Bismol for symptomatic relief.\nCurrent output is about 200 cc/D of stool.\n\n6) METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  The patient had both a lactic\nacidosis and a nonanion gap acidosis on admission.  His\nlactic acidosis was from his sepsis, and his nonanion gap\nacidosis was likely from chronic diarrhea.  These both\nimproved with hydration and the bicarb drip, and are not\ncurrently an issue.\n\n7) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  This occurred also in the setting of\nsepsis and hypotension.  This has resolved to the patient's\nbaseline creatinine after IV hydration, as well.\n\n8) NON-ST ELEVATION MI:  The patient ruled in after admission\nwith a peak troponin of 0.2.  His CKs and MBs were never\npositive.  This was likely a demand ischemia event in the\nsetting of sepsis.  He had his aspirin restarted and was kept\non beta blocker when his blood pressure tolerated this.  He\nhas had no signs of GI bleeding on the aspirin at this time.\n\n9) RIGHT ARM VENOUS CLOT:  This occurred in the setting of a\nright IJ central line.  The central line was pulled, and the\npatient is now on Lovenox and Coumadin.  The plan is to\nanticoagulate for 1 month in the setting of known intravenous\nprecipitant for the clot.  Edema of the right arm is now\nresolved.\n\n10) ENDOCRINE:  The patient has no known history of diabetes,\nbut has had increased blood sugars this entire\nhospitalization, even after the sepsis has resolved.  He was\ninitially on insulin drip, and has now been converted to\ninsulin sliding scale.  He will likely need to be converted\nto oral insulin therapy upon discharge.\n\n11) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been\nmaintained on Criticare tube feeds as a low-residue,\nlow-osmolar formula to help decrease his diarrhea.  His\nvolume status is currently still volume overloaded, and he is\nbeing actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg IV bid.  His volume\nstatus should be assessed daily for adjustment of this and\nconversion to PO lasix.  Replete potassium to be greater than\n4, and magnesium to be greater than 2.\n\n12) ACCESS:  The patient has poor IV access after his right\nIJ was discontinued.  He had a left midline PICC placed by IV\ntherapy on [**2146-12-14**] for purposes of blood draws, intravenous\nlasix, and labs.\n\n13) HYPERTENSION:  This is well-controlled on current\nLopressor, ACE inhibitor and Norvasc doses.\n\n14) PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient is on lansoprazole for GI\nprophylaxis and Risperdal 0.5 mg q hs for sleeping\nmedication.  Communication daily with son, [**Name (NI) **], and his\nwife.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to the medicine\nteam on the floor today to the geriatric service.

Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\nLet me analyze the text. The key term here is \"Social ETOH\". ETOH stands for \"ethanol\", which is the alcohol component in beverages. The term \"Social ETOH\" typically indicates that the patient consumes alcohol socially, which suggests current use. Additionally, the patient is described as a smoker, but that's separate from alcohol use. Since there's no mention of quitting or stopping alcohol use, it's likely that the patient is still using alcohol. Therefore, the label should be \"Present\".\nReasoning: The text mentions \"Social ETOH\", which indicates current alcohol use. There is no indication that the patient has stopped using alcohol.\nLabel: Present\nThe text includes \"Social ETOH\", which is a clinical shorthand for current alcohol use. The presence of this term, without any indication of cessation or abstinence, strongly suggests ongoing use. The other details (smoking, living with wife, working in a bakery) are unrelated to alcohol use status. Therefore, the label is \"Present\".\nReasoning: \"Social ETOH\" is a standard clinical abbreviation for current alcohol use. The absence of any mention of quitting or abstinence confirms that the patient is still using alcohol.\nLabel: Present\n\nThe key term \""

History of tobacco; he smoked 2 packs\nper day for 50 years but quit in [**2180**]. Occasional cigar. No\nhistory of IV drug use, tattoos or piercing.

Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\nOkay, let's break this down. The patient's social history mentions \"Occasional alcohol.\" That suggests he uses alcohol sometimes, but not regularly. Then there's a mention of \"History of tobacco; he smoked 2 packs per day for 50 years but quit in [**2180**].\" The quit date is in the future, which might be a typo, but even so, he quit smoking. The text also says \"Occasional cigar,\" which might be a separate issue. There's no mention of current alcohol use, but \"occasional\" could mean he uses it sometimes. However, the key here is that the text doesn't specify if he currently uses alcohol. The phrase \"Occasional alcohol\" might mean he uses it occasionally in the past, but not currently. But since it's not specified whether it's current or past, maybe the label is \"None\" because it's not clear if he's currently using it. Wait, but \"occasional\" could imply current use. Hmm. But the label options are Present, Past, or None. If the text says \"occasional alcohol\" without specifying current or past, but the rest of the history doesn't mention current use, maybe it's"

The key part is \"rare EtOH,\" which suggests she doesn't use it regularly. Since she's not currently using it and there's no indication she does now, the label should be Past. Wait, but wait, the text says she quit tobacco 20 years ago, but does it say she ever used alcohol? The phrase \"rare EtOH\" might mean she used it occasionally in the past but not now. So the label would be Past because she used it in the past but no longer does. Alternatively, if \"rare\" means she never used it, then it would be None. But the wording is \"rare EtOH,\" which is a bit ambiguous. However, given that she's a former tobacco user, it's more likely that she had some alcohol use in the past but not currently. So the answer is Past.\nLabel: Past\nReasoning: The patient mentions she has \"rare EtOH,\" indicating past alcohol use, and there's no mention of"

So the label should be Present.\nReasoning: The text states \"Occasional EtOH,\" indicating current, but not regular, alcohol use. The mention of \"No tobacco\" is unrelated to alcohol use in this context.\nLabel: Present\n\nWait, but the user might be confused. Let me check again. The patient is described as having \"Occasional EtOH.\" The term \"occasional\" implies that the patient does use alcohol, but not frequently. So it's current use, not past. Therefore, the label should be Present. The answer is correct.\nReasoning: The patient's social history notes \"Occasional EtOH,\" which indicates current, albeit infrequent, alcohol use. There is no mention of past use or cessation.\nLabel:"

Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\nOkay, let's look at the text. The patient denies tobacco, EtOH, and illicit drugs. So they're saying they don't use those. The label for alcohol is \"EtOH\", which stands for ethanol, so that's alcohol. Since they deny EtOH, that means they don't use it now. The text also mentions they live with their wife and are a retired teacher and coach. But there's no mention of past use. The key here is that they specifically deny current use. So the label should be \"None\" because they're not a current or past user. Wait, but the question is about alcohol use. The patient denies EtOH, so that's current use. But the label options are Present, Past, or None. If they deny current use, then Present would be incorrect. Since they don't mention past use either, it's None. Wait, but the problem is that the patient is not described as a current or past user. The text says \"denies EtOH\", so that's current use. But the label is about the status. If they deny current use, then the label is None. Because Present is if they currently use, Past is if they used before but not now. Since they deny EtOH"

Even though there's a mention of a history of alcohol abuse, the key point here is the current frequency of use. The phrase \"Etoh 1/week\" directly indicates that the patient is using alcohol regularly, which would classify as present use. The history of abuse doesn't change the current status. So the label should be Present. \n\nWait, but the text also says \"reports had history of alcohol abuse.\" Does that affect anything? No, because the current use is specified.

Despite multiple\nattempts to decrease the patient's sedation and attempt to\nwean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was unable\nto be weaned from the ventilator as of [**2145-2-25**].\n\n2.

Multiple cultures were sent including a\nbronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and\nlegionella and positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  Multiple blood\ncultures and sputum cultures were negative.  The patient was\ncontinued on Levaquin as described above.

Cardiovascular:  Hypotension:  The patient's hemodynamics\nwere aggressively monitored.  He was given intravenous fluids\nas necessary for hypotension.  Eventually the patient\nrequired blood pressure support with pressors.  These were\nrequired intermittently.

Initially these were responsive to\ndiltiazem or spontaneously converted on their own.  One\nepisode was associated with hypotension and the patient was\nattempted for DC cardioversion.  He did not respond to this\nand an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure\nsupport from pressors.  The patient spontaneously converted\non this.  He was then maintained on amiodarone po.  He\nsuffered from one additional atrial fibrillation episode.  An\namiodarone drip was started again and the patient was\nreturned to amiodarone po.

Endocrine:  Given the patient's pressor requirements, it\nwas presumed that the patient was potentially adrenally\ninsufficient and would benefit from steroids.  He was\nmaintained on intravenous hydrocortisone throughout the\ncourse of the admission.\n\n6.  Fluid status:  The patient received large amounts of\nintravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout\nthe admission.  He was ultimately 22 liters positive for the\nlength of stay.

The patient's family felt\nthat the patient would not want to live with this degree of\nlife support and began discussions regarding withdrawal of\ncare.  One of the patient's sons, however, was in\ndisagreement regarding this plan.

On neurologic examination, he had\npinpoint pupils; nonreactive, no response to corneas or dolls\nmaneuver.  No gag.  The patient had slight withdrawal of both\nupper extremities, and no response in either leg.  Nail bed\npressure was given.  No reflexes.\n\nPERTINENT LABORATORY VALUES ON PRESENTATION:  Initial\nlaboratories from the outside hospital revealed his white\nblood cell count was 13,000.  His platelets were 300,000.\nCoagulations were normal.\n\nBRIEF\n\nYou are an expert clinician.

There is no indication of current or past alcohol consumption.\nLabel: None\nOkay, let's see. The user provided a patient's social history text and wants to determine the alcohol use status. The options are Present, Past, or None. \n\nFirst, I need to look through the text carefully. The patient is described as an ex-smoker, but there's no mention of alcohol. The rest of the text talks about physical examination, blood pressure, pulse, intubation, and other medical findings. The laboratory values are also mentioned, but nothing about alcohol use.\n\nThe key here is that the question is specifically about alcohol. The text doesn't say the patient uses alcohol now or has used it in the past. The only mention is of being an ex-smoker, which is unrelated to alcohol. Since there's no information about alcohol, the correct label should be None. \n\nI should make sure not to assume anything beyond what's written.

There is no mention of past use. Label: None\nOkay, let's break this down. The patient's social history says he's a long-time smoker but denies any alcohol or illicit drug use. The key here is the denial of alcohol use. Since he's currently in a nursing home and his daughter lives nearby, but the text doesn't mention any past use. The label should be based on his current status. He denies current use, and there's no indication of past use either. So the correct label is None.\nLabel: None"

But wait, sometimes \"occasional\" can imply past use. However, the label \"Past\" requires that they no longer use it. The text doesn't say they stopped. So the safest label here is Present, as the patient is described as using alcohol, even if not regularly. Alternatively, maybe \"None\" if it's not current or past. But since \"occasional\" is mentioned, it's a current use. So the answer is Present.\nLabel: Present\nReasoning: The patient's social history explicitly mentions \"Occas"

The text also says they retired from a job in Country 532 and moved to the US in 2118. However, the important part is the explicit statement that they do not use ETOH. Since there's no mention of past use, just current abstinence, the label should be None. Wait, but wait. The text says \"No tobacco, ETOH or drugs\" \u2013 that's current status.

But wait, sometimes in medical records, if someone says they don't use, it's possible they were a past user. But the text doesn't mention any past use.

The text says he \"used to sniff heroin\" but has been off it since 2141 and is on methadone. Also, he denies any ETOH (alcohol) and mentions occasional marijuana. So, he's not currently using alcohol. But the question is about his alcohol use status. The key part is \"Denies any ETOH,\" which means he doesn't use alcohol now. He used to use heroin, but that's a different substance. Since he's not using alcohol currently and doesn't mention any past use, the label should be None. Wait, but the text says he used to sniff heroin, but that's not alcohol. The denial of ETOH is explicit. So the answer is None.\nLabel: None\nReasoning: The patient explicitly denies current alcohol use (ETOH) and there is no mention of past alcohol use. His history includes heroin use in the past, but that is distinct from alcohol. Therefore, he is neither currently using nor has a history of alcohol use. \n\nLabel: None\n\n"

The key point is that the patient explicitly denied alcohol use, so there's no indication of current or past use. \n\nThe physical examination part doesn't mention anything about alcohol use either. So the only relevant part is the social history. The label should be None because the patient is not described as a current or past user. The answer is None"

The text doesn't mention anything about alcohol consumption. The only substance mentioned is smoking. So there's no information here about alcohol use. Therefore, the label should be \"None\" because the patient isn't described as a current or past user of alcohol.\nLabel: None\n\nReasoning: The text mentions a smoking history but provides no information about alcohol use.

The text mentions \"Social ETOH,\" which is a common abbreviation for \"Social Alcohol Use.\" This typically indicates that the patient has a history of alcohol use. However, the key here is the phrase \"Denies tobacco,\" which might be a red herring. The main clue is \"Social ETOH.\" In clinical settings, \"Social ETOH\" is often used to denote that the patient has a history of alcohol use, but it doesn't explicitly state whether they currently use it. However, since the patient is described in the context of their social history, and there's no mention of current use, it's more likely that \"Social ETOH\" refers to past use. But wait, sometimes \"Social ETOH\" can also mean they use alcohol socially, implying current use. Hmm, but the presence of \"Denies tobacco\" might be a clue that the patient is being assessed for substance use, and \"Social ETOH\" might indicate a past use. Wait, but the patient is described as \"Denies tobacco,\" which might be a separate issue. The key is that \"Social ETOH\" is part of their social history. In many clinical contexts, \"Social ETOH"

She also states she has never had a history of daily or excessive drinking, which suggests she hasn't used alcohol in a problematic way in the past. However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether she has ever used alcohol at all. The denial of current use and past excessive use might imply she hasn't used alcohol in a significant way.

The user's query is about determining the alcohol use status. The given text doesn't mention alcohol at all. The only mention is of smoking history, which is separate.

The patient's social history mentions \"Rare ethanol use.\" The term \"rare\" suggests that the use is infrequent or not regular. Now, the question is whether this qualifies as current use. Since \"rare\" implies that it's not a regular or ongoing habit, it might be considered past use. However, if the use is recent but still infrequent, it could be present. But the term \"rare\" is more about frequency than timing. The text doesn't mention any recent cessation, so it's a bit ambiguous. However, in clinical terms, \"rare\" might be classified as past use because it's not a current habit. Alternatively, if the use is occasional but not discontinued, it might be present. But the key is that \"rare\" is more about infrequency than current status. So the label is likely Past.\nLabel: Past\n\nReasoning: The text mentions \"rare ethanol use,\" which indicates infrequent or occasional use rather than current or regular use.

Lives in an acquired\nimmunodeficiency syndrome group house.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  On admission\ntemperature was 96.4, pulse 88, blood pressure of 132/64,\noxygen saturation 100% on room air and 98% on ambulation.  In\ngeneral, lethargic.  Head, ears, nose, eyes and throat\nrevealed the right eye deviated to the right.  Chest had fine\ncrackles on the left.  Heart had a regular rate and rhythm.\nA 2/6 systolic murmur at the apex.  The abdomen was\ndistended, dull flanks, nontender.  Extremities revealed no\nedema.  Neurologically, positive for asterixis.\n\nLABORATORY DATA ON PRESENTATION:  On admission white blood\ncell count was 12.2, hemoglobin 12.9, hematocrit 36.7,\nplatelets 120.  Differential of 88% neutrophils, 6.3%\nlymphocytes.  PT 14.5, PTT 37.8, INR of 1.5.

ALT\nof 161, AST 232, alkaline phosphatase 179, total\nbilirubin 3.3, albumin 2.7.  Serum toxicology screen was\nnegative.\n\nRADIOLOGY/\n\nYou are an expert clinician. Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\nOkay, let's see. The patient's social history mentions \"Two cases of beer per week.\" Wait, \"cases\" here might be a typo or slang. In alcohol terms, a \"case\" is 12 bottles, but that's probably not the case here. More likely, it's a mistake and they mean \"cans\" or \"bottles.\" So two bottles per week. That's a small amount, but it's still alcohol use. The patient also has a history of intravenous drug abuse, last heroine use three months ago. But the question is about alcohol use. The social history explicitly states beer consumption, so that's current use. The label should be Present. The lab results are negative for toxins, but that doesn't affect the social history. The key point is the beer consumption, which indicates current use. So the answer is Present.\nLabel: Present\nReasoning: The patient reports consuming two cases of beer per week, indicating current alcohol use. The mention of beer consumption in the social history directly supports the \"Present\" label, as it reflects ongoing alcohol use. The negative toxicology screen does not negate the reported alcohol consumption. The history of IV drug use is separate and does not affect the alcohol use classification. The"

The patient's ETOH (alcohol) section says \"Couple times a month. 1 mixed drink or beer.\" Then there's a checkmark under \"< 1 drink/week [x]\". Wait, that seems contradictory. If they have 1 drink a month, that's less than 1 drink per week. But the checkmark is under \"< 1 drink/week\", which might mean they actually consume less than one drink per week. However, the first part says \"Couple times a month,\" which is about 2-3 times a month. If each time is 1 drink, that's about 0.2-0.5 drinks per week, which is less than 1. So the patient is currently consuming alcohol, but at a very low frequency. The key is whether this counts as current use. Since they mention it, even if it's infrequent, it's still current use.

The patient's social history mentions \"1.5 ppd, +THC, occ ETOH\". The key here is \"occ ETOH\", which stands for \"occasional ethanol use\". The term \"occasional\" suggests that the patient uses alcohol but not regularly or to the point of being a current heavy user. The \"1.5 ppd\" likely refers to 1.5 drinks per day, which is a measure of alcohol consumption. However, the term \"occasional\" might indicate that this is not a regular or current pattern. But wait, if they are consuming 1.5 drinks per day, that's a regular amount, which might not be \"occasional\". This is a bit confusing. The presence of \"occ ETOH\" could mean that the patient uses alcohol occasionally, but the 1.5 ppd might suggest a more regular use. However, the term \"occasional\" might be a typo or shorthand. Alternatively, maybe the \"occ\" is part of the abbreviation, like \"occasional\" for ETOH. If the patient is consuming alcohol at 1.5 drinks per day, that's a current use."

There\nis a Q wave in AVF.  Compared with a prior study form [**2165**]\natrial fibrillation and a T wave inversion in lead three are\nboth new findings.\n\nIn summary, this 73 year-old gentleman with a history of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma presents\nwith shortness of breath, right sided chest pain that is\npleuritic in nature as well as onset of shaking and chills on\nthe day of presentation to the Emergency Department.  He is\nfound to have bibasilar pneumonia by CT of the chest.\nHowever, the CT of the chest is not consistent with evidence\nof a pulmonary embolus.  The patient was initially admitted\nto the Medical Flor and treated for pneumonia.  He received\nintravenous Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency\nDepartment for empiric treatment of his pneumonia given his\nhistory of past aspiration pneumonia in the postoperative\nsetting.  Blood cultures were obtained in the Emergency\nDepartment.  The sputum culture was not obtained initially,\nbut was obtained later when the patient arrived on the\nmedical floor.  The patient was continued on non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs for his pleuritic chest pain as well\nas Toradol for pain control.\n\nIn terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation this was new in\nonset likely secondary to this pneumonia.  The patient's rate\nwas controlled with Diltiazem.  When the patient was\ntransferred to the medical floor he was noted to be in sinus\nrhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for his time on the\nmedical floor as well as for the duration of his stay in the\nIntensive Care Unit.\n\nIn terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the\npatient was continued on MDI and nebulizers.\n\nIn terms of GI the patient was put on Zantac.  He was also\nput initially on intravenous heparin when he was admitted to\nthe medical floor.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, he was put on\na house diet as tolerated with intravenous fluids until the\npatient was taking better po and his electrolytes were\nfollowed.\n\nThe patient on the [**12-5**] in the early evening at\napproximately 8:00 p.m. was noted to be hypotensive on the\nmedical floor with blood pressures 60s/40s and oxygen\nsaturation dropping from 86% on 2 liters increasing to 89 to\n90% on 5 liters.  He was then put on a 50% ventimask, which\nincreased his oxygenation to 93%.  Subsequently it dropped to\n91%.  The patient was then put on 50% face mask and his\noxygen saturation remained approximately 91%.  In the setting\nof his hypoxia as well as his hypotension the patient was\ntransferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further\nevaluation.  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nthe patient's blood pressure continued to be approximately\n50s to 60s systolic over 40s diastolic.  The patient was,\nhowever, mentating quite well throughout this period of\nhypotension.  He had a right femoral line placed on arrival\nto the Intensive Care Unit as well as a left arterial line\nplaced.  The patient was then started on Levophed at initial\ndose of 10 micrograms per minute as well as on Vasopressin as\ndose of 0.04 units per minute.  The patient was continued on\nthese pressors overnight for additional blood pressure\nsupport.  The patient also was treated with 2 liters of\nnormal saline run wide open for additional pressure support.\nThe patient was not responsive to the fluid resuscitation and\ntherefore did require the initiation of the pressors as\nmentioned.  The patient was continued on Levo, Flagyl and\nVancomycin was also started.\n\nThe patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found to\nbe not elevated.  His CK and troponin were both within the\nnormal range.  In terms of rhythm, the patient was not in\natrial fibrillation on transfer to the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit and remained in sinus rhythm during his stay in the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit.\n\nAs mentioned on the evening of admission he was hypotensive\nwith blood pressure 60s/40s.  Given his pneumonia and\nsignificant bandemia as well as a history of shakes and\nchills prior to admission it was felt that the patient was\nseptic.  He was put on pressors for blood pressure support,\ngiven fluid 2 liters as mentioned and he was continued on\nbroad spectrum antibiotics.  From a pulmonary standpoint he\nwas treated for the pneumonia as mentioned.  The heparin drip\nwas discontinued, because the patient had no evidence of a PE\non CTA.  He was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as\nwell as Flovent and Serevent given his history of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.  His blood gas on admission to\nthe MCI was 737, 29, 77.  From a GI standpoint the patient\nwas continued on Zantac.  From a renal FEN standpoint, the\npatient was NPO.  His potassium was repleted and intravenous\nfluids for initial level of 3.1.  It was noted that his\ncreatinine increased to 1.4 from 0.6 on admission likely\nsecondary to poor perfusion in the setting of hypotension.\nHis creatinine was followed closely every day.  From an\ninfectious disease standpoint the patient's sputum was sent\nfor culture.  Preliminary data showed 4+ gram positive coxae\nin pairs and clusters as well as 1+ gram positive rods.  At\nthe time of this dictation there is no additional data on\nrespiratory culture.  The patient's temperature max on the\nmedical floor was 100.  He did not spike a temperature during\nhis stay in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nOn the second day in the Intensive Care Unit on the morning\nfollowing his transfer the patient had remained on a\nnonrebreather with O2 sats in the high 90s overnight.  His\nLevophed was starting to be titrated down from 10 to 6 and\nultimately down to 3.  His Vasopressin was at 0.04 overnight\non the first evening in the Intensive Care Unit.  He also\nreceived q 2 hour nebulizers overnight.  Laboratory data on\nthe morning following his admission to the MICU included a\nwhite count increased to 11.2, hematocrit stable at 33.8,\nrepeat electrolytes showed a sodium of 134, potassium 6.1,\nchloride 106, bicarb 15, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 103.\nCKs were 101, 84, and 82.

Your task is to analyze the text and determine the status of the patient's **alcohol use**, using one of the following three labels:\n- Present: The patient currently uses alcohol.\n- Past: The patient used alcohol in the past but no longer does.\n- None: The patient is not described as a current or past user of alcohol.\n\nText:\nSignificant for a thirty six pack year\nhistory.  He quit tobacco in [**2151**].  He lives with his wife in\n[**Name (NI) 4565**].  His daughter lives here in the [**Name (NI) 86**] area.\n\nPHYSICAL EXAMINATION ON PRESENTATION:  His temperature is\n97.9, heart rate 130, blood pressure 106/65, O2 sat 92% on\nroom air.  The patient is in mild respiratory distress with\naudible upper airway congestion.  He appears to be quite\nfatigued.  HEENT examination sclera anicteric.  He has small\npupils, which are reactive to light.  Dry mucous membranes\nand no oral lesions.  Neck is supple with no lymphadenopathy.\nLungs have coarse upper airway breath sounds throughout.\nThere is good air movement.  Cardiovascular examination he is\ntachycardic with a irregular irregular rhythm.  Normal S1 and\nS2.  No murmurs, rubs or gallops is heard.  Abdomen is soft,\nnontender, nondistended.  He has central obesity.  There are\nnormoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are without clubbing,\ncyanosis or edema.  There is no calf tenderness or swelling\nnoted on physical examination.\n\nINITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.4 with 67%\npolys, 11% bands, 18% lymphocytes and 2% monocytes.\nHematocrit 33.2, hemoglobin 11.4, platelet count 248, MCV 92,\nRDW 12.6, sodium 142, potassium 3.1, chloride 111, bicarb 21,\nBUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 122.  PT 13.7, PTT 28.2, INR\n1.3.  AST is 10, alkaline phosphatase 53, total bili 0.9,\namylase 12, CK 101 with an MB of 1 and a troponin of less\nthen 0.3.  Imaging studies showed a chest CT, which shows\nbilateral lower lobe consolidations posteriorly.  There is a\nsmall right pleural effusion and a trace left pleural\neffusion.  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  There\nis a small subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes,\nprevascular, pretracheal and subcranial.  Electrocardiogram\nis notable for atrial fibrillation on initial presentation to\nthe Emergency Department with a rate of 126, axis 15 degrees,\nT wave inversion in lead 3, T wave flattening in AVF.  There\nis a Q wave in AVF.  Compared with a prior study form [**2165**]\natrial fibrillation and a T wave inversion in lead three are\nboth new findings.\n\nIn summary, this 73 year-old gentleman with a history of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma presents\nwith shortness of breath, right sided chest pain that is\npleuritic in nature as well as onset of shaking and chills on\nthe day of presentation to the Emergency Department.  He is\nfound to have bibasilar pneumonia by CT of the chest.\nHowever, the CT of the chest is not consistent with evidence\nof a pulmonary embolus.  The patient was initially admitted\nto the Medical Flor and treated for pneumonia.  He received\nintravenous Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency\nDepartment for empiric treatment of his pneumonia given his\nhistory of past aspiration pneumonia in the postoperative\nsetting.  Blood cultures were obtained in the Emergency\nDepartment.  The sputum culture was not obtained initially,\nbut was obtained later when the patient arrived on the\nmedical floor.  The patient was continued on non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs for his pleuritic chest pain as well\nas Toradol for pain control.\n\nIn terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation this was new in\nonset likely secondary to this pneumonia.  The patient's rate\nwas controlled with Diltiazem.  When the patient was\ntransferred to the medical floor he was noted to be in sinus\nrhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for his time on the\nmedical floor as well as for the duration of his stay in the\nIntensive Care Unit.\n\nIn terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the\npatient was continued on MDI and nebulizers.\n\nIn terms of GI the patient was put on Zantac.  He was also\nput initially on intravenous heparin when he was admitted to\nthe medical floor.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, he was put on\na house diet as tolerated with intravenous fluids until the\npatient was taking better po and his electrolytes were\nfollowed.\n\nThe patient on the [**12-5**] in the early evening at\napproximately 8:00 p.m. was noted to be hypotensive on the\nmedical floor with blood pressures 60s/40s and oxygen\nsaturation dropping from 86% on 2 liters increasing to 89 to\n90% on 5 liters.  He was then put on a 50% ventimask, which\nincreased his oxygenation to 93%.  Subsequently it dropped to\n91%.  The patient was then put on 50% face mask and his\noxygen saturation remained approximately 91%.  In the setting\nof his hypoxia as well as his hypotension the patient was\ntransferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further\nevaluation.  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nthe patient's blood pressure continued to be approximately\n50s to 60s systolic over 40s diastolic.  The patient was,\nhowever, mentating quite well throughout this period of\nhypotension.  He had a right femoral line placed on arrival\nto the Intensive Care Unit as well as a left arterial line\nplaced.  The patient was then started on Levophed at initial\ndose of 10 micrograms per minute as well as on Vasopressin as\ndose of 0.04 units per minute.  The patient was continued on\nthese pressors overnight for additional blood pressure\nsupport.  The patient also was treated with 2 liters of\nnormal saline run wide open for additional pressure support.\nThe patient was not responsive to the fluid resuscitation and\ntherefore did require the initiation of the pressors as\nmentioned.  The patient was continued on Levo, Flagyl and\nVancomycin was also started.\n\nThe patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found to\nbe not elevated.  His CK and troponin were both within the\nnormal range.  In terms of rhythm, the patient was not in\natrial fibrillation on transfer to the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit and remained in sinus rhythm during his stay in the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit.\n\nAs mentioned on the evening of admission he was hypotensive\nwith blood pressure 60s/40s.  Given his pneumonia and\nsignificant bandemia as well as a history of shakes and\nchills prior to admission it was felt that the patient was\nseptic.  He was put on pressors for blood pressure support,\ngiven fluid 2 liters as mentioned and he was continued on\nbroad spectrum antibiotics.  From a pulmonary standpoint he\nwas treated for the pneumonia as mentioned.  The heparin drip\nwas discontinued, because the patient had no evidence of a PE\non CTA.  He was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as\nwell as Flovent and Serevent given his history of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.  His blood gas on admission to\nthe MCI was 737, 29, 77.  From a GI standpoint the patient\nwas continued on Zantac.  From a renal FEN standpoint, the\npatient was NPO.  His potassium was repleted and intravenous\nfluids for initial level of 3.1.  It was noted that his\ncreatinine increased to 1.4 from 0.6 on admission likely\nsecondary to poor perfusion in the setting of hypotension.\nHis creatinine was followed closely every day.  From an\ninfectious disease standpoint the patient's sputum was sent\nfor culture.  Preliminary data showed 4+ gram positive coxae\nin pairs and clusters as well as 1+ gram positive rods.  At\nthe time of this dictation there is no additional data on\nrespiratory culture.  The patient's temperature max on the\nmedical floor was 100.  He did not spike a temperature during\nhis stay in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nOn the second day in the Intensive Care Unit on the morning\nfollowing his transfer the patient had remained on a\nnonrebreather with O2 sats in the high 90s overnight.  His\nLevophed was starting to be titrated down from 10 to 6 and\nultimately down to 3.  His Vasopressin was at 0.04 overnight\non the first evening in the Intensive Care Unit.  He also\nreceived q 2 hour nebulizers overnight.  Laboratory data on\nthe morning following his admission to the MICU included a\nwhite count increased to 11.2, hematocrit stable at 33.8,\nrepeat electrolytes showed a sodium of 134, potassium 6.1,\nchloride 106, bicarb 15, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 103.\nCKs were 101, 84, and 82.  Troponin less then 0.3.  Calcium\n7.7, phos 3.4, magnesium 2.3.  Cortisol was sent off and came\nback at 14.  Coagulation studies revealed a PT of 14.5, PTT\n32.8, INR of 1.5.  Microbiology data still with a sputum gram\nstain 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters, 1+ gram\npositive rods.  No respiratory culture data as of yet.\n\nIn terms of the patient's pneumonia he was continued on Levo,\nFlagyl and Vancomycin.  White blood cell count was noted to\nbe up, however, the patient remained afebrile and his oxygen\nsaturation remained good on the nonrebreather.\n\nIn terms of his hypotension and sepsis, the decision was made\nto give the patient 1 liter of D5W with 3 amps of bicarb to\nbe repeated times two or three as needed for blood pressure\nsupport.  It was also decided to start the patient on high\ndose steroids Hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hours times three\ndoses.  There was discussion with the team whether the\npatient would be a candidate for activated protein C.  The\nconclusion was that the patient would possibly be a candidate\nand the team decided to wait to see how he did throughout the\nafternoon on the [**12-6**] before actually starting the\npatient on the activated protein C.\n\nIn terms of the patient's renal failure his creatinine was\n1.4 again the morning following his admission to the MICU.  A\nnotable increase from his baseline of .6.  It was felt that\nthis bump in his creatinine was due to hyperperfusion in the\nsetting of hypotension and the patient was given hydration as\nmentioned with 1 liter fluid boluses.  He was continued on\nLevofloxacin and Vancomycin at full dose as opposed to\nrenally dosing them given how sick he was.\n\nIn terms of his acid base status, the patient's bicarb was 16\non the morning following his admission to the MICU.  His\nlactate was up to 3.5.  His morning blood gas was 7.33, 34,\n87 indicating the patient was adequately compensating for his\nmetabolic acidosis.\n\nFrom a GI standpoint the patient was continued on Zantac.  In\nterms of prophylaxis the patient was put on subcutaneous\nheparin.  In terms of pain the patient was continued on\nToradol for his pleuritic chest pain.\n\nAt the time of this dictation, which is the [**12-7**] the\npatient has been off of his Levophed since 3:00 p.m. on [**2172-7-6**].

Even though he used to drink a lot, his current consumption is low. The label needs to be based on current status. Since he's drinking occasionally now, that's present use. But wait, the text says \"now drinks one to two alcoholic drinks a month.\" So that's current use, right? The label should be Present. The past is only if he doesn't use it now. Since he's using it now, even if it's minimal, it's present. The answer is Present.\nLabel: Present\n\nReasoning: The patient currently consumes one to two alcoholic drinks per month, indicating ongoing alcohol use despite past heavy drinking.  \nLabel: Present\n\nWait, but the user's instruction says to follow the strict format.

The label should be \"None\" because they are not a current user and there's no mention of past use. Wait, but the rehab could be for past use.

But in the second part, the user might have intended to have the reasoning and label in the same message. Let me check again.\n\nThe user provided a text that only mentions smoking, not alcohol.

The phrase \"rarely drinks\" suggests that he doesn't consume alcohol frequently. However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether he currently drinks or if he used to. The mention of \"used to work as a manager\" might imply past alcohol use, but that's not directly related. The key is that he's currently a nonsmoker, but the alcohol use is mentioned as \"rarely.\" Since he's retired and the text doesn't mention any recent cessation, but the \"rarely\" could mean he might still use it occasionally.

The second part mentions the patient is recently widowed, which could imply a recent loss, possibly leading to increased alcohol use as a coping mechanism. However, the text doesn't explicitly state whether the patient currently uses alcohol or if they have stopped. The mention of \"recently widowed\" might suggest a past use, but without more context, it's a bit ambiguous. However, since there's no explicit mention of stopping, it's safer to assume that the patient is still using alcohol. So the label would be Present.\nLabel: Present\nReasoning: The text mentions \"ETOH us at home,\" indicating current alcohol use. The mention of being recently widowed may suggest a potential for increased use, but the explicit statement of use at home points to current usage. Therefore, the label is Present. \n\nLabel: Present\n\nReasoning: The text indicates that the patient uses alcohol (\"ETOH us at home\"), which suggests current use.

The phrase \"no EtOH\" is a bit confusing. EtOH stands for ethanol, which is the main component of alcohol. So \"no EtOH\" might mean the patient does not consume alcohol now. However, the mention of \"quit 20 years ago\" suggests that they stopped using alcohol 20 years back. But the \"2ppd\" part is a bit ambiguous. If they quit 20 years ago, then they wouldn't be currently using alcohol. The \"no EtOH\" part might be emphasizing that they don't use it now. But wait, the \"2ppd\" could be their past usage. So the patient used alcohol (2 drinks per day) in the past, quit 20 years ago, and now does not use it. Therefore, the label should be Past."

However, I need to check if \"occasional\" is considered present or past. In medical terms, \"occasional\" is usually classified as current use.

Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\nOkay, let's break down the text. The patient is described as a non-smoker, which is one part of their social history. The next part says \"rare Etoh,\" which I think stands for \"rare alcohol use.\" The term \"rare\" here probably means that the patient doesn't use alcohol frequently or at all. Then it mentions \"no illicits,\" which refers to no illicit drug use. The rest of the text talks about their job and family status, which doesn't relate to alcohol use.\n\nSo, \"rare Etoh\" suggests that the patient doesn't use alcohol regularly. Since there's no mention of current or past use beyond that, it's likely that they don't use alcohol at all. The label \"None\" would mean they are not a current or past user, which fits here because \"rare\" implies minimal or no use. The other labels, \"Present\" or \"Past,\" don't apply because there's no indication of current use or a history of use. Therefore, the correct label is \"None.\"\nLabel: None\nReasoning: The text mentions \"rare Etoh,\" indicating minimal or no alcohol use.

The text mentions \"past history of alcohol abuse,\" which clearly indicates the patient used alcohol in the past. However, it also says \"current intake unknown.\" That part is a bit tricky. If the current intake is unknown, does that mean they might still be using it or not? But since the past history is specified and there's no mention of current use, the safest label would be \"Past\" because the current status isn't confirmed.

Therefore, the label should be Past.\nLabel: Past\n\nReasoning: The text explicitly states \"past history of alcohol abuse,\" indicating previous use.

The text also says \"Tobacco - quit in 2140,\" which is a future date, but that's probably a placeholder. The alcohol part is more important. Since it's \"rare use,\" it might indicate that they don't use it currently. However, \"rare use\" could also mean they use it occasionally but not regularly. But in clinical terms, \"rare use\" is often interpreted as not using it at all. So the label would be \"None\" because there's no mention of current or past use, just that it's used rarely. Wait, but if they use it rarely, is that considered past or present? Hmm. If they use it occasionally, maybe it's present. But the term \"rare\" might imply that they don't use it much, possibly not at all. But the problem is that the text doesn't explicitly say they don't use it.

However, sometimes \"occasional\" might be used in a past context, but without additional information like \"no longer uses\" or \"former,\" it's safer to assume that \"occasional\" is a current status. But wait, in some clinical contexts, \"occasional\" might be used to describe past use. Hmm. However, the absence of any indication that the patient has stopped using alcohol would mean that \"occasional\" is current. But the label options are Present, Past, or None. Since the text doesn't specify that the patient has stopped, \"occasional\" is more likely current. But maybe \"occasional\" is considered past? I need to check.

The text mentions that Ms. [Known lastname 40558] has a history of asthma and oxycontin abuse on methadone. However, it specifically states she denied any history of IVDU (injection drug use). Additionally, it notes that there's no etoh/tobacco/illicit drug use in pregnancy. \n\nThe key here is the phrase \"no etoh/tobacco/illicit drug use in pregnancy.\" Since the patient is referring to her use during pregnancy, and it's stated that there's no alcohol use during that time, it suggests she hasn't used alcohol in the current pregnancy. However, the text also mentions a history of oxycontin abuse on methadone, which might imply past drug use. But the question is specifically about alcohol use.\n\nThe text doesn't mention any current alcohol use, and it explicitly states there's no alcohol use during pregnancy. However, the label options are Present, Past, or None. Since the text doesn't provide information about past alcohol use beyond the current pregnancy, and the denial of use during pregnancy might indicate that she hasn't used alcohol in the past either.

His sodium gradually\nimproved up to 132 with improvement in his creatinine to 1.9\nwithout dialysis.\n\nDue to poor PO intake, a nutrition consult was obtained. TPN\nwas started. [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained for management of\nhyperglycemia with improvement in mental status. The\npatient's oral intake improved and TPN was stopped. Physical\ntherapy worked with him initially recommending rehab but with\nimprovement in mental status. It was felt that the patient\nwould be safe to be discharged to home or to family member's\nhome. He was ambulatory in the hallway with supervision.\n\nThe patient experienced significant weight gain and pedal\nedema. This was treated with IV Lasix with improvement of\nedema. He was switched to Lasix 20 mg PO once daily. His\nweight dropped down to 100.3 from preoperative weight of\n114.1. He had two JP drains. These were removed and sutured\nand he experienced large volume output from the medial JP up\nto 2 liters per day. The JP drain was removed and the site\nsutured without further leaking his incision. A duplex of the\nabdomen was done on [**5-10**]. Patent hepatic and portal\nvessels were noted.  Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive\nstudies were done to evaluate edema. This was done on [**5-17**]. There was no evidence of DVT.\n\nOn [**5-18**], a post-pyloric bleeding tube was placed for\nconcerns that the patient would not be able to meet his\ncaloric intake need. Unfortunately the patient pulled out his\npost-pyloric feeding tube during the night. This was not\nreplaced given improved mental status. The patient was taking\nin at least 1800 Kcal the following day. Improved mental\nstatus was attributed to less steroids given.\n\nIn summary, the patient has been in stable condition,\nambulatory, tolerating a regular diet, his incision clips\nwere opened at the top of the incision in his left lateral\nside for leaking of serosanguineous drainage. Normal saline\ndamp to dry dressings were placed on the open areas b.i.d.\nHis liver function tests improved with an AST of 22, ALT of\n39, alkaline phosphatase 75, and total bilirubin of 0.8,\ncreatinine was down at 1.9. His hematocrit was stable in the\nrange of 25.2 to 27.3. Platelet count was 114. He continued\non immunosuppression with CellCept, prednisone and Prograf\nwhich was adjusted. This was titrated to 1 mg PO b.i.d for a\nlevel of 17.9.\n\nPlan was to send the patient home and not to rehab given\nimproved mental status. It is anticipated that he will be\ndischarged home to his brother's home with follow up in the\noutpatient clinic.\n\nYou are an expert clinician.

Since there's no mention of current use, and it's stated they have no history, the label should be \"None.\" Because \"None\" is when the patient isn't described as a current or past user.

The text mentions \"mod EtOH,\" which stands for moderate alcohol use. The term \"mod\" likely indicates that the patient consumes alcohol in a moderate amount. The \"T/DOA\" part is unclear, but since it's followed by \"mod EtOH,\" it might be a note about the patient not having a history of alcohol dependence or abuse. The \"student\" part could refer to the patient being a student, which might be relevant for their lifestyle but not directly related to alcohol use status. Since \"mod EtOH\" is explicitly stated, it suggests current use, but the context might imply that it's a moderate level. However, without more details, the key point is that the patient is described as having moderate alcohol use, which is current. The label should be \"Present\" because the text indicates current use, not past or none.\nLabel: Present\nReasoning: The text states \"mod EtOH,\" indicating moderate alcohol use, which suggests current consumption.

The patient is described as a \"presumed narcotic abuser given suboxone use.\" Suboxone is a medication used in the treatment of opioid dependence, so that suggests a history of opioid use. However, the text mentions \"unable to assess at this time [1-26] sedation.\" The mention of suboxone use indicates that the patient has been using opioids, which are narcotics. The term \"presumed\" might imply that the diagnosis is based on some evidence, like suboxone use, but the text doesn't explicitly state whether the patient is currently using alcohol. There's no mention of alcohol in the text. The focus is on narcotics and suboxone. Since there's no information about alcohol use, the label should be None. The patient's history is related to narcotics, not alcohol.

Since the patient is denying alcohol use, that would indicate they don't currently use it. There's no mention of past use either.

The text says \"unable to obtain,\" which means the data isn't available. So the label should be None because the patient isn't described as a current or past user.

Then it mentions there's no current alcohol abuse. The other parts about working in a cemetery, never married, and no kids don't relate to alcohol use. The key part here is \"no current alcohol abuse,\" which indicates that the patient isn't using alcohol now. But does that mean they never used it before? The text doesn't explicitly say they used alcohol in the past. However, the fact that they quit tobacco suggests they might have had some substance use in the past. But the question is about alcohol specifically. Since the text only mentions no current use and doesn't state any past use, maybe the label is \"None.\" Wait, but \"no current alcohol abuse\" could mean they might have used it before but not now. However, the label \"Past\" requires that they used it in the past but no longer do. The text doesn't mention past alcohol use, only that there's no current abuse. So maybe the correct label is \"None\" because there's no information about past use. Alternatively, if \"no current abuse\" implies they never used it, but that's not necessarily the case.

But in medical terms, \"ETOH: socially\" is often used to denote that the patient uses alcohol in social contexts but not to a problematic extent. However, the key is whether it's current.

But wait, sometimes \"socially\" is used to indicate that the patient uses alcohol occasionally, which could be present. Alternatively, if the patient is described as \"socially\" using alcohol, it might mean they use it in social situations, which is current.
