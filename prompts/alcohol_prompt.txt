You are given a patient's social history text. Your task is to analyze the text and determine the status of the patient's **alcohol use**. You need to return a json file.

For each text provided, you must generate and can only generate two lines, the first line should only contain one of possible labels, the next line should begin with "Reasoning":
1. Label: Classify the patient's alcohol use with one of the following three labels.
    - Present: The patient currently uses alcohol.
    - Past: The patient used alcohol in the past but no longer does.
    - None: The patient is not described as a current or past user of alcohol.
2. Reasoning: Provide a concise, one-sentence explanation for your chosen label, quoting or referencing the specific text that supports your conclusion.
