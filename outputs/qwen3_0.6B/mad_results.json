There is no mention of alcohol use in the text.\nLabel: Present\nReasoning: The text does not explicitly state the patient's current alcohol use. However, the patient is experiencing severe pain and unable to move, which may suggest a current health issue. Since there is no mention of alcohol use, the label is \"None\". Wait, but the example for \"Present\" was when the text explicitly states the use. Here, the text doesn't mention alcohol use. So the correct label would be \"None\". But the example provided earlier for the first text was \"None\". Let me check again. In",
