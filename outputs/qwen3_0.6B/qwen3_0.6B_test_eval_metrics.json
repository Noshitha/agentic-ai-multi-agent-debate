The detox was done at age 45, which suggests that he's been using alcohol since then. Since he's been using alcohol for a long time (up to 12 beers weekly) and has a history of multiple substances, it's likely he's not currently using alcohol. However, the label needs to be one of the three options. \n\nThe text says he \"reported experimental marijuana in youth only\" and \"had an extensive polysubstance abuse history.\" The detox is at age 45, which might indicate he started using alcohol after that.

The patient's social history mentions that they are a daughter and a son. Also, they have a history of being at rehabilitation since a recent hip fracture. The key here is to determine if they currently use alcohol. The text says they have a history of being at rehabilitation, which is a medical facility. But the mention of being at rehabilitation since a fracture suggests they might have been in a rehabilitation program. However, the social history also says they are supportive of their daughter and son, which are HCPs. Wait, but the original text says \"Daughter is supportive, son is HCP.\" So maybe the son is a health care provider, but does that relate to alcohol use? The main point here is that the patient is described in the social history as being in a rehabilitation facility, but the question is about their current alcohol use. The text doesn't explicitly state that they use alcohol. It mentions they have a history of being in rehabilitation, but there's no direct mention of current usage. The presence of tobacco"

The patient has a history of PPD and quit smoking 40 years ago. The question is about their alcohol use. The text mentions they quit smoking 40 years ago, but does not mention anything about alcohol. The presence of PPD (which is about exposure to chemicals) and the mention of quitting smoking don't directly relate to alcohol. Since there's no information about alcohol use in the text, I should label it as None. The reasoning is that there's no mention of alcohol in their social history. So, the answer should be None.\n</s>\n\nReasoning: The patient quit smoking 40 years ago but has no information about their alcohol use. Therefore, the status is None.\nLabel: None\n<some"

In general,\nthe patient was a well-nourished gentleman in no acute\ndistress.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate\nand rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs were\nclear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was\ntympanitic and distended, mildly tender in the right upper\nquadrant, with no rebound or guarding.  Extremity examination\nrevealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic\nexamination was grossly nonfocal.  Cranial nerves II through\nXII were intact.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The\npatient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.\n\n1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient was\ntransfused multiple units of packed red blood cells and fresh\nfrozen plasma.  The patient's Coumadin was held.  His INR was\n2.5 on admission.

A nasogastric lavage was\nrepeated which showed coffee-grounds followed by fresh clots\nof red blood.\n\nThe patient was sent to Interventional Radiology for an\nangioembolization.  An angioembolization was done to the\ngastroduodenal artery on [**7-25**].  This procedure was\ncomplicated with a right groin hematoma.\n\nOn [**7-26**], the patient's hematocrit was still slowly\ndropping.  Interventional Radiology and Surgery were\nconsulted again.  The patient was sent for a repeat\nembolization on [**7-28**].  This embolization was\ncomplicated with a left groin hematoma and pseudoaneurysm.\n\nFollowing the second angioembolization, the patient's\nhematocrit remained stable for 24 hours, and he was\ntransferred to the medicine floor from the unit.  The patient\nreceived a total of 14 units of packed red blood cells and 10\nunits of fresh frozen plasma in the unit.

The patient\nreceived 2 units of packed red blood cells, and 2 units of\nfresh frozen plasma, and 1 mg of intravenous vitamin K.\n\nVascular Surgery was consulted again, and the patient was to\ngo for repair of the left femoral pseudoaneurysm.  The\npatient's hematocrit was stable for the next three days at\napproximately 32.  His INR was corrected to 1.3.\n\nOn [**8-3**], the patient was taken to the operating room\nfor pseudoaneurysm repair.  On [**8-4**], the patient was\nfound to still have a slowly dropping hematocrit once again.\nHe was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.  A\nrepeat esophagogastroduodenoscopy was done on [**8-5**]\nwhich was negative.  The patient's hematocrit remained stable\nat approximately 30 until discharge.\n\n2.  CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was ventricularly\npaced, and therefore ischemia was unable to be evaluated\nbased on his electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department.\nThe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and his\nantihypertensive medications were held.  The patient's blood\npressure remained stable throughout his hospitalization.\n\n3.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of\nchronic constipation.  The patient was placed on a bowel\nregimen which included Senna and docusate.  The patient was\nalso placed on simethicone for complaints of bloating.  The\npatient had regular bowel movements after being transferred\nto the floor and did not have any further gastrointestinal\ncomplaints.  The patient was also started on Viokase with\nmeals for possible pancreatic dysfunction.\n\n4.  COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient was initially admitted\non Coumadin with an INR of 2.5 following reversal of\nanticoagulation with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K  while\nthe patient was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.  Once the\npatient was transferred to the floor, his INR continued to\nincrease to a maximum level of 2.9.  The patient again\nreceived 2 more units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 mg of\nintravenous vitamin K while on the floor and then placed on\noral vitamin K to maintain his INR at less than 1.5.  The\npatient was discharged with an INR of 1.3 which remained\nstable following the initial reversal with fresh frozen\nplasma and vitamin K.\n\n5.

The patient was awake, moaning,\nmoving hands and feet to command.  Reflexes - trace at the\nankles, 1+ brachial.  Skin had no rashes.  A small foot\nulcer, dressed, over the ball of the right foot.  There was a\nright scar from previous vascular surgery on his right leg.\n\nLABS ON ADMISSION:  White blood count 27.4, hematocrit 36.4,\nplatelets 404, sodium 143, potassium 2.6, chloride 114,\nbicarbonate 11, BUN 54, creatinine 2.4, glucose 175, anion\ngap 18, change in his anion gap/change in his bicarbonate\nequals less than 0.5, calcium 9.4, magnesium 1.6, phosphorus\n1.7, ALT 9, AST 13, alk phos 95, total bilirubin 0.7, albumin\n3.4, LDH 130, total protein 5.5, amylase 94, lipase 48, CK\n20, troponin 0.05, PT 14.5, PTT 28, INR 1.4.  ABG initially\non room air 7.26/26/64/12, lactate 5.4.  Chest x-ray on\nadmission shows a left lower lobe infiltrate and a right IJ\ncentral line in good position.  Urinalysis - specific gravity\n1.021, small blood, [**1-20**] white cells, [**10-7**] red cells, 0\nbacteria, positive hyaline casts.  EKG - sinus rhythm, 96,\nnormal axis, normal intervals, 0.[**Street Address(2) 1755**] depressions V1\nthrough V3.\n\nPERTINENT STUDIES THIS ADMISSION:  [**2146-12-5**], the patient\nhad a portable KUB to assess for ?bowel obstruction, and it\ndid show a possibility of early partial small bowel\nobstruction, and recommended follow-up.  Follow-up study done\non [**2146-12-7**] showed no evidence for intestinal obstruction.\nCT of the head without contrast done [**2146-12-9**]--this was\ndone for a history of prior CVA with now change in mental\nstatus.  It showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, and\ntissue loss noted in the left thalamus consistent with his\nold known hemorrhagic stroke.\nUltrasound of his right upper extremity done [**2146-12-12**] for\nedematous right arm showed nonocclusive clot within the right\nIJ and one of his two brachial veins thrombosed.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE FROM [**0-0-0**]:  This is a\n[**Age over 90 **]-year-old male, with a history of chronic diarrhea, past\nhemorrhagic CVA, who was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12573**] Intensive\nCare Unit with an aspiration pneumonia after vomiting, and\nsubsequent development of sepsis and respiratory failure.\nPostextubation, it was noted that the patient had new left\nleg weakness and left facial droop with new dysarthria.\n\n1) SEPTIC SHOCK:  This was likely secondary to a SIRS\nreaction, status post severe aspiration pneumonia and\npneumonitis.  The patient was admitted on the MUST sepsis\nprotocol.  During his first hospital day, he was hypotensive\nand required both Levophed and vasopressin to keep his mean\narterial pressure greater than 65, his lactic acidosis peaked\nwith a lactate level of 6.0, and he was placed on a\nbicarbonate drip in the setting of both nongap and anion gap\nacidosis.  He also required an insulin drip.  His cortisol\nstimulation test was negative with a baseline cortisol of 100\nin the setting of his sepsis which is an appropriate\nresponse.  His aspiration pneumonia was treated with a 9-day\ncourse of ceftazidime, vancomycin and Flagyl to cover\nnosocomial aspiration.  The vancomycin was switched to\noxacillin after sensitivities came back on a Staph aureus\nthat grew out of his sputum that showed it to be sensitive to\noxacillin.\n\nThe patient improved rapidly after his early intervention in\nsepsis therapy and was weaned off vasopressors by hospital\nday #2.  He completed the remainder of his antibiotic course\nand did not have any further temperature spikes for the\nremainder of his ICU course.\n\n2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient required intubation for\nrespiratory distress in the setting of acute aspiration\npneumonia and pneumonitis, as well as increased respiratory\ndrive from two metabolic acidosis processes.  He was able to\nbe quickly weaned off his ventilator, as his sepsis also\nrapidly improved.  He was extubated on [**2146-12-8**] after some\ndiuresis to remove volume that had been given during his\nacute sepsis.  He remained extubated and has gradually had\nimproving pulmonary toilet over the past few days.  The\npatient is currently on a scoop mask with 12 liters of flow\nand has had stable O2 sats of 95% or greater since then.\n\n3) NEUROLOGIC:  After extubation, it became apparent that Mr.\n[**Known lastname 12574**] had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria,\ndysphagia, and left leg weakness.  A head CT done to rule out\nany acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known\nhemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  His\nneurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the\npast few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved.\nHe has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has\n4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop\nis also improved.  He currently is requiring NG tube for\nfeeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation.\nThe plan will be to reevaluate him on Monday, [**12-19**], to\nsee if his swallowing has improved with his improved\ndysarthria.  He will be continued on an aspirin a day for\nstroke prophylaxis.  It is likely that this stroke occurred\nin the setting of low-flow during his hypotensive episodes.\n\n4) GI BLEEDING:  Upon admission, the patient had guaiac\npositive NG output and stool, although there was no gross\nblood, melena or coffee grounds from this output.  He did\nhave a total of 3 units of packed RBCs during his\nhospitalization with a hematocrit drop from 34 down to 26,\nand 3 units of blood required to get him above 30.  He was\ninitially started on Protonix and sucralfate for presumed\nstress gastritis.  After this intervention, he had no further\nsigns of GI bleeding, and his hematocrit has remained stable\nsince [**2146-12-7**].  He was then changed to lansoprazole\ntherapy only.\n\n5) CHRONIC DIARRHEA:  The patient did not have diarrhea while\nNPO, and his diarrhea restarted in the setting of his tube\nfeeds.  He had no further nausea or vomiting on admission.\nCultures of his stool were negative.  C. difficile x 3 was\nnegative.  Stool Osm gap was also nondiagnostic.  He was seen\nby his outpatient gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12575**], during this\nhospitalization who feels that he will perform a flexible\nsigmoidoscopy when his respiratory status is improved.  We\nwill currently continue Pepto-Bismol for symptomatic relief.\nCurrent output is about 200 cc/D of stool.\n\n6) METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  The patient had both a lactic\nacidosis and a nonanion gap acidosis on admission.  His\nlactic acidosis was from his sepsis, and his nonanion gap\nacidosis was likely from chronic diarrhea.  These both\nimproved with hydration and the bicarb drip, and are not\ncurrently an issue.\n\n7) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  This occurred also in the setting of\nsepsis and hypotension.  This has resolved to the patient's\nbaseline creatinine after IV hydration, as well.\n\n8) NON-ST ELEVATION MI:  The patient ruled in after admission\nwith a peak troponin of 0.2.  His CKs and MBs were never\npositive.  This was likely a demand ischemia event in the\nsetting of sepsis.  He had his aspirin restarted and was kept\non beta blocker when his blood pressure tolerated this.  He\nhas had no signs of GI bleeding on the aspirin at this time.\n\n9) RIGHT ARM VENOUS CLOT:  This occurred in the setting of a\nright IJ central line.  The central line was pulled, and the\npatient is now on Lovenox and Coumadin.  The plan is to\nanticoagulate for 1 month in the setting of known intravenous\nprecipitant for the clot.  Edema of the right arm is now\nresolved.\n\n10) ENDOCRINE:  The patient has no known history of diabetes,\nbut has had increased blood sugars this entire\nhospitalization, even after the sepsis has resolved.  He was\ninitially on insulin drip, and has now been converted to\ninsulin sliding scale.  He will likely need to be converted\nto oral insulin therapy upon discharge.\n\n11) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been\nmaintained on Criticare tube feeds as a low-residue,\nlow-osmolar formula to help decrease his diarrhea.  His\nvolume status is currently still volume overloaded, and he is\nbeing actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg IV bid.  His volume\nstatus should be assessed daily for adjustment of this and\nconversion to PO lasix.  Replete potassium to be greater than\n4, and magnesium to be greater than 2.\n\n12) ACCESS:  The patient has poor IV access after his right\nIJ was discontinued.  He had a left midline PICC placed by IV\ntherapy on [**2146-12-14**] for purposes of blood draws, intravenous\nlasix, and labs.\n\n13) HYPERTENSION:  This is well-controlled on current\nLopressor, ACE inhibitor and Norvasc doses.\n\n14) PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient is on lansoprazole for GI\nprophylaxis and Risperdal 0.5 mg q hs for sleeping\nmedication.  Communication daily with son, [**Name (NI) **], and his\nwife.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to the medicine\nteam on the floor today to the geriatric service.  He is\ncurrently also being screened for rehab versus return to\n[**Hospital 100**] Rehab after improvement in his pulmonary toilets on\nthe floor.\n\nDNR STATUS:  The patient is Do Not Resuscitate, but he would\nlike to be intubated in the event of respiratory\nfailure.",

Wait, but the text says he drinks occasionally, but does that mean he's currently using it? Or is it just that he does it sometimes? The wording is \"alcohol only occasionally.\" So if he's currently using it, then it's Present. But the problem is, is there any indication that he's using it now? The text says he drinks occasionally. So, if he's currently using it, then Present. If he's not using it now, then None. But the text doesn't mention any time frame. The answer depends on whether \"alcohol only occasionally\" implies that he is currently using it. Since"

Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\n<your final answer>\n\nOkay, let's see. The patient is a retired car salesman and WWII vet. The text mentions he drinks alcohol socially, smokes 1-2 packs a day for 60 years. Lives alone, his wife passed in month 116. Has two sons and three daughters nearby.\n\nFirst, the question is about alcohol use status. The key points here are the period of time he uses it. The statement says he smokes 1-2 packs per day for 60 years. That suggests he's been using it for a long time, possibly for years. But is this considered current, past, or none?\n\nIf he's been using alcohol for 60 years, then it's past. Because past users have used it for a while but not necessarily now. However, the term \"smokes [1-2] packs per day\" might indicate that he's been doing it for the past 60 years. But maybe he's still using it now. Wait, but the text doesn't mention any current use. The past is when he used it, and now he's not using it. So the answer would be Past.\n\nBut wait, the label options are Present, Past, or None."

Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\n<Your reasoning>\n<Your final answer>\n\nOkay, let's see. The patient's social history says they are married with two sons, 40 and 23. They are employed as an \"expediter\" at Company 7546. They are a nonsmoker and have Etoh - 1 glass wine a month. They also deny drug use.\n\nSo, the key points here are their employment and alcohol consumption. The patient is currently employed, and they have a monthly wine consumption. Since they deny drug use, but are using alcohol, I need to determine if this is a current use.\n\nThe question is whether the patient is currently using alcohol. The text mentions they have Etoh - 1 a month, which is alcohol. Even though they deny drug use, they are still using alcohol. Therefore, the status should be Present. The reasoning is that they are currently using alcohol, even if they deny drug use. The past would be if they had used before but no longer, but they are using now. So the answer is Present.\nThe patient currently uses alcohol, as evidenced by their monthly wine consumption and employment. They deny drug use, which aligns with the \"Present\" label.\nReasoning: The patient"

Therefore, the label is None.\nAnswer:\nReasoning: The text states the patient is currently in a rehab facility, which implies they are not currently using alcohol. However, since the text does not mention any past alcohol use, the label is Past. But wait, the text doesn't mention past use. It just says they are in rehab. So the correct label is Present? Wait, the text says \"From [Hospital rehab] h/o smoking. Good family supports.\" So the patient is currently in rehab, which is a present status, but no alcohol use is mentioned. So the label should be None. But the answer options are Present, Past, or None. The text doesn't say the patient is using alcohol, only that they are in rehab. Therefore, the answer is None.

The patient's social history says they were a stock broker, out of work since ICU admission in 2174, married with two children, and they deny tobacco, alcohol, and drugs. The question is about their alcohol use status. The key here is that they \"denies tobacco, alcohol, drugs.\" So they have denied alcohol, but does that mean they currently use it? If they were out of work since ICU admission in 2174, maybe they were using alcohol before that. But the text doesn't mention their current status. It just says they are out of work. So based on the denial, they don't use alcohol. Since they deny it, the status should be \"None\" because they aren't described"

Respiratory for hypoxic respiratory failure.  The patient\nwas continued on mechanical ventilation with low tidal\nvolumes and pressures with PEEP for presumed adult\nrespiratory distress syndrome.  He was treated with albuterol\nand Atrovent MDIs as necessary.  A bronchoscopy was performed\nwhich revealed nonspecific changes.  The patient's ventilator\nsettings were adjusted as necessary to maintain stable oxygen\nsaturations and minimize pressures.  Despite multiple\nattempts to decrease the patient's sedation and attempt to\nwean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was unable\nto be weaned from the ventilator as of [**2145-2-25**].\n\n2.  Infectious Disease:  For the patient's pneumonia, he was\nbegun on Ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially.  This was then\nchanged to Levaquin.  Multiple cultures were sent including a\nbronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and\nlegionella and positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  Multiple blood\ncultures and sputum cultures were negative.  The patient was\ncontinued on Levaquin as described above.  On [**2145-2-14**],\nthe patient was hypotensive and hypothermic and was felt to\nbe septic and a question of vent acquired pneumonia was\nraised.  The patient was then resumed on vancomycin and\nCeftriaxone for presumed vent acquired pneumonia.  The\npatient continued to have temperatures and despite multiple\ncultures and changing of access lines, the patient's cultures\nremained negative.  Antibiotics were continued.\n\n3.  Cardiovascular:  Hypotension:  The patient's hemodynamics\nwere aggressively monitored.  He was given intravenous fluids\nas necessary for hypotension.  Eventually the patient\nrequired blood pressure support with pressors.  These were\nrequired intermittently.  During the week of [**2145-2-21**],\nthe patient's pressor requirement remained high requiring\nlarge doses of Neo-Synephrine which were unable to be weaned\npreviously in the patient's course, his pressor requirement\nwas intermittent but during the days between [**2-21**] and\n[**2-25**], the patient's pressor requirements remained steady\nand high and he was unable to be weaned to lower doses.\n\n4.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient developed periods of\natrial fibrillation throughout the course of the\nhospitalization.  Initially these were responsive to\ndiltiazem or spontaneously converted on their own.  One\nepisode was associated with hypotension and the patient was\nattempted for DC cardioversion.  He did not respond to this\nand an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure\nsupport from pressors.  The patient spontaneously converted\non this.  He was then maintained on amiodarone po.  He\nsuffered from one additional atrial fibrillation episode.  An\namiodarone drip was started again and the patient was\nreturned to amiodarone po.  He was also seen in consultation\nby the Cardiology Service who recommended amiodarone\nintravenous and po, as was executed.\n\n5.  Endocrine:  Given the patient's pressor requirements, it\nwas presumed that the patient was potentially adrenally\ninsufficient and would benefit from steroids.  He was\nmaintained on intravenous hydrocortisone throughout the\ncourse of the admission.\n\n6.  Fluid status:  The patient received large amounts of\nintravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout\nthe admission.  He was ultimately 22 liters positive for the\nlength of stay.  By [**2145-2-25**], attempts to diurese the\npatient with Lasix were met with hypotension and episodes of\natrial fibrillation as described above.  The patient's\nintravenous medications were double concentrated in order to\nminimize the patient's intravenous input, however, attempts\nto remove fluid were unsuccessful as described above.\n\n7.  Access:  The patient received central lines for\nadministration of intravenous medications and arterial lines\nfor hemodynamic monitoring.  On [**2145-2-19**], during a\nroutine change of the patient's central line for question\ninfection, the patient suffered a complication of internal\njugular catheter placement.  He had a tension pneumothorax\nwith hypotension and decreased oxygen saturations.  Needle\nthoracostomy was performed immediately and the patient's\nblood pressure returned.  A chest tube was placed thereafter.\nThe patient's family was informed of these complications and\nhe suffered no further complications from the chest tube.\n\n8.  Disposition:  During the week of [**2145-2-21**], it\nbecame apparent that the patient's prognosis was poor, that\nmultiple attempts to decrease sedation, ventilatory support\nand pressors were unsuccessful.  The patient's family felt\nthat the patient would not want to live with this degree of\nlife support and began discussions regarding withdrawal of\ncare.  One of the patient's sons, however, was in\ndisagreement regarding this plan.  Talks continued and\nultimately on [**2145-2-24**], the patient's family was in\nagreement that the patient should be \"Do Not Resuscitate\" and\nthey intended to withdrawal care the following day.  On [**2145-2-25**], the patient's family came to the Medical Intensive\nCare Unit and agreed to withdrawal care from the patient.\n\nAt approximately 10:30 in the morning, the patient's life\nsupport was discontinued.  The patient was extubated and\npressors were turned off.  He was kept comfortable with\nmorphine drip and bolus along with intravenous Ativan.

The patient's social history mentions that she lives in a rehab facility for past three years since a stroke. Also, she has a daughter with whom she has a good relationship. The key here is to determine if she uses alcohol. The rehab facility is a place where alcohol use is typically addressed, especially for someone with a stroke. Since she's in rehab for three years, it's likely she's been using alcohol in the past. The mention of a daughter might not directly relate to alcohol use. The rehab history suggests she's been on treatment for alcohol addiction, so the label should be Past because she's been using it in the past but no longer. The daughter's relationship doesn't affect the current use status. So, Present is possible, but since she's in rehab, it's more likely she's been using it in the past. Therefore, the label should be Past.\nReasoning: The patient is in a rehab facility for three years after a stroke, indicating past use. The presence of a daughter and the rehab context strongly suggest she has been using alcohol in the past. None is not applicable here. Present: The patient"

The text says he has verbal fights with one sister, but does that indicate he uses alcohol? The text doesn't mention anything about alcohol use. The presence of sisters and frequent contact might imply he is not using alcohol, but without explicit information, it's unclear. However, based on the given text, there's no direct mention of alcohol use. Therefore, the correct label should be None. But the previous reasoning suggested Present. Maybe I made a mistake here.\nWait, the original text says \"has involved sisters, though he has verbal fights with one sister.\" So maybe he's involved in the relationship with the sisters, which could mean he uses alcohol.

Follow this strict format:\nReasoning: <one or two sentences explaining your decision>\nLabel: <Present | Past | None>\n<Your reasoning here>\n<Your answer here>\n\nOkay, let's see. The patient's social history says they are married, works as a products manager, and have a 60-year-old age. Also, they mention a 2110 quit smoking history. Wait, the quit date is in the brackets as [2110], which is probably a typo or formatting issue. The key points here are their age and smoking history. The question is about alcohol use. The text doesn't mention anything about smoking or drinking. They are married, working in a software company, and have a smoking history. The only mention of quitting smoking is at 2110, which is likely a placeholder. Since there's no information about alcohol use, the correct label would be None. The reasoning is that there's no mention of alcohol consumption in the social history. So the answer should be None.\nThe reasoning is that there's no information about alcohol use in the social history, so the patient is not described as a current or past user. The answer is None.\nReasoning: The text does not mention any information about alcohol use, so the patient is not described as a current or past user of alcohol. Label: None\n<Your answer here"

The text says the patient has 4 glasses of wine per night. That immediately sounds like they are currently using alcohol. They also mention quitting smoking in 2093, which means they are a current user. The other details about their smoking history, marriage, family, and work don't indicate any change in their alcohol use. So the answer should be Present.\n\nBut wait, the previous reasoning had two conflicting options. Let me check again. The first reasoning says Present because they use alcohol. The second says they are not a past user. But the text says they quit smoking in 2093, which would make them a current user. So the correct answer is Present. The user probably has two separate entries,"

So, the key points here are that he's in a facility, not drinking, and smoked for 20 years. Now, the question is about his alcohol use status. \n\nFirst, the facility is long-term care. I know that in such facilities, people might be on medical or nursing care, and they might not engage in alcohol consumption. The presence of the facility suggests a specific context where alcohol use is unlikely. Also, the time frame given is 20 years, which is quite long. If someone has been in a long-term care facility for 20 years and hasn't smoked or consumed alcohol, it's possible they're not currently using alcohol. \n\nBut wait, the text says \"he does not drink alcohol, and has not smoked for 20 years.\" So, the time frame is 20 years.

The patient's social history says they have smoked 60 packs a year, quit in 2157. They also mention no alcohol use. They live in an independent living facility with a 24-hour aide, uses a walker or wheelchair, has a son and daughter in NJ and the area. The children are reporting they're normally alert and oriented, but can get confused at times.\n\nSo, the key points here are that they quit smoking in 2157 and no alcohol use. The question is about their current or past use. Since they quit smoking and there's no mention of alcohol use, the answer should be \"None\". The labels are present, past, or none. The fact that they quit smoking and no alcohol use directly points to \"None\" because there's no evidence they use alcohol now or in the past. The reasoning is straightforward: no mention of alcohol use, no indication of current or past use.\nReasoning: The patient has quit smoking in 2157 and no alcohol use. Therefore, there is no evidence of alcohol use, so the label is None. Label: None\n\nReasoning: The patient has quit smoking in 2157 and"

The patient's social history says she lives at home with her parents, works as a tutor, no illicit drug use, occasionally drinks alcohol, and no tobacco abuse. The question is about her alcohol use status. The key points here are that she occasionally drinks alcohol but doesn't mention her current use. Since there's no information about whether she uses alcohol now or if she's stopped, and the labels are Present, Past, or None. The absence of specific information about current or past use means it's not clear. But the problem is, the text says she \"occasionally drinks alcohol.\" But does that mean she's using it now or just having a regular habit? If it's just a habit, then it's present. But if it's a past habit, then past. The text doesn't specify. However, the label options are given. Since there's no explicit mention of current or past use, and the answer has to be one of the three, I think the correct label is Present. Wait, but sometimes people might use \"occasionally\" to mean past. Hmm. Wait, the text says \"occasionally drinks alcohol and has no history of tobacco abuse.\" So"

The text doesn't state that he's currently using alcohol or that he's not. So, based on the information provided, we can't determine if he is currently using alcohol.

The patient's smoking history is 70 packs a year, which is a lot. Then, they have a history of alcohol use four to six beers a day. So, the question is whether they currently use alcohol.

Even if they smoke a lot, if they are still consuming alcohol, it's still present. But does the smoking history imply anything?

The text says the patient is non-smoking, has occasional EtOH use, no illicit drug use, married, employed as a book editor, and swims long distance. The key here is to determine if the patient is currently using alcohol. The mention of \"occasional EtOH\" implies that they do use alcohol at least once a week, which is likely a current use. Since there's no information about them using it more frequently or no longer, the status should be Present. The other options, Past or None, don't fit here. The answer should be Present.\nThe patient currently uses alcohol, as indicated by the mention of \"occasional EtOH use.\" No information is provided about past or future use, so the status is Present.\n"

The key here is to determine if the patient is currently using alcohol, has used it in the past but no longer, or not described. The text mentions quitting drinking 40 years ago and quitting smoking 11 years ago. So, the patient has stopped drinking 40 years ago, which implies that they are no longer using alcohol.

The status of being \"present\" requires that she is currently using it, which isn't directly stated. The text doesn't mention her current use, only her history and current status. Therefore, based on the information given, we can't confirm that she is currently using alcohol. Hence, the label would be None, since there's no explicit mention of current use.\nBut wait, \"occasional ETOH\" could imply she uses it, but maybe she doesn"

Now, the question is about their alcohol use. They mention they drink 2-3 alcoholic drinks one night a week. Since they are currently using alcohol, that would be Present.

He has central obesity.  There are\nnormoactive bowel sounds.  Extremities are without clubbing,\ncyanosis or edema.  There is no calf tenderness or swelling\nnoted on physical examination.\n\nINITIAL LABORATORY DATA:  White blood cell count 6.4 with 67%\npolys, 11% bands, 18% lymphocytes and 2% monocytes.\nHematocrit 33.2, hemoglobin 11.4, platelet count 248, MCV 92,\nRDW 12.6, sodium 142, potassium 3.1, chloride 111, bicarb 21,\nBUN 16, creatinine 0.6, glucose 122.  PT 13.7, PTT 28.2, INR\n1.3.  AST is 10, alkaline phosphatase 53, total bili 0.9,\namylase 12, CK 101 with an MB of 1 and a troponin of less\nthen 0.3.  Imaging studies showed a chest CT, which shows\nbilateral lower lobe consolidations posteriorly.  There is a\nsmall right pleural effusion and a trace left pleural\neffusion.  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  There\nis a small subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes,\nprevascular, pretracheal and subcranial.  Electrocardiogram\nis notable for atrial fibrillation on initial presentation to\nthe Emergency Department with a rate of 126, axis 15 degrees,\nT wave inversion in lead 3, T wave flattening in AVF.  There\nis a Q wave in AVF.  Compared with a prior study form [**2165**]\natrial fibrillation and a T wave inversion in lead three are\nboth new findings.\n\nIn summary, this 73 year-old gentleman with a history of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma presents\nwith shortness of breath, right sided chest pain that is\npleuritic in nature as well as onset of shaking and chills on\nthe day of presentation to the Emergency Department.  He is\nfound to have bibasilar pneumonia by CT of the chest.\nHowever, the CT of the chest is not consistent with evidence\nof a pulmonary embolus.  The patient was initially admitted\nto the Medical Flor and treated for pneumonia.  He received\nintravenous Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency\nDepartment for empiric treatment of his pneumonia given his\nhistory of past aspiration pneumonia in the postoperative\nsetting.  Blood cultures were obtained in the Emergency\nDepartment.  The sputum culture was not obtained initially,\nbut was obtained later when the patient arrived on the\nmedical floor.  The patient was continued on non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs for his pleuritic chest pain as well\nas Toradol for pain control.\n\nIn terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation this was new in\nonset likely secondary to this pneumonia.  The patient's rate\nwas controlled with Diltiazem.  When the patient was\ntransferred to the medical floor he was noted to be in sinus\nrhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for his time on the\nmedical floor as well as for the duration of his stay in the\nIntensive Care Unit.\n\nIn terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the\npatient was continued on MDI and nebulizers.\n\nIn terms of GI the patient was put on Zantac.  He was also\nput initially on intravenous heparin when he was admitted to\nthe medical floor.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, he was put on\na house diet as tolerated with intravenous fluids until the\npatient was taking better po and his electrolytes were\nfollowed.\n\nThe patient on the [**12-5**] in the early evening at\napproximately 8:00 p.m. was noted to be hypotensive on the\nmedical floor with blood pressures 60s/40s and oxygen\nsaturation dropping from 86% on 2 liters increasing to 89 to\n90% on 5 liters.  He was then put on a 50% ventimask, which\nincreased his oxygenation to 93%.  Subsequently it dropped to\n91%.  The patient was then put on 50% face mask and his\noxygen saturation remained approximately 91%.  In the setting\nof his hypoxia as well as his hypotension the patient was\ntransferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further\nevaluation.  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nthe patient's blood pressure continued to be approximately\n50s to 60s systolic over 40s diastolic.  The patient was,\nhowever, mentating quite well throughout this period of\nhypotension.  He had a right femoral line placed on arrival\nto the Intensive Care Unit as well as a left arterial line\nplaced.  The patient was then started on Levophed at initial\ndose of 10 micrograms per minute as well as on Vasopressin as\ndose of 0.04 units per minute.  The patient was continued on\nthese pressors overnight for additional blood pressure\nsupport.  The patient also was treated with 2 liters of\nnormal saline run wide open for additional pressure support.\nThe patient was not responsive to the fluid resuscitation and\ntherefore did require the initiation of the pressors as\nmentioned.  The patient was continued on Levo, Flagyl and\nVancomycin was also started.\n\nThe patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found to\nbe not elevated.  His CK and troponin were both within the\nnormal range.  In terms of rhythm, the patient was not in\natrial fibrillation on transfer to the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit and remained in sinus rhythm during his stay in the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit.\n\nAs mentioned on the evening of admission he was hypotensive\nwith blood pressure 60s/40s.  Given his pneumonia and\nsignificant bandemia as well as a history of shakes and\nchills prior to admission it was felt that the patient was\nseptic.  He was put on pressors for blood pressure support,\ngiven fluid 2 liters as mentioned and he was continued on\nbroad spectrum antibiotics.  From a pulmonary standpoint he\nwas treated for the pneumonia as mentioned.  The heparin drip\nwas discontinued, because the patient had no evidence of a PE\non CTA.  He was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as\nwell as Flovent and Serevent given his history of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.  His blood gas on admission to\nthe MCI was 737, 29, 77.  From a GI standpoint the patient\nwas continued on Zantac.  From a renal FEN standpoint, the\npatient was NPO.  His potassium was repleted and intravenous\nfluids for initial level of 3.1.  It was noted that his\ncreatinine increased to 1.4 from 0.6 on admission likely\nsecondary to poor perfusion in the setting of hypotension.\nHis creatinine was followed closely every day.  From an\ninfectious disease standpoint the patient's sputum was sent\nfor culture.  Preliminary data showed 4+ gram positive coxae\nin pairs and clusters as well as 1+ gram positive rods.  At\nthe time of this dictation there is no additional data on\nrespiratory culture.  The patient's temperature max on the\nmedical floor was 100.  He did not spike a temperature during\nhis stay in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nOn the second day in the Intensive Care Unit on the morning\nfollowing his transfer the patient had remained on a\nnonrebreather with O2 sats in the high 90s overnight.  His\nLevophed was starting to be titrated down from 10 to 6 and\nultimately down to 3.  His Vasopressin was at 0.04 overnight\non the first evening in the Intensive Care Unit.  He also\nreceived q 2 hour nebulizers overnight.  Laboratory data on\nthe morning following his admission to the MICU included a\nwhite count increased to 11.2, hematocrit stable at 33.8,\nrepeat electrolytes showed a sodium of 134, potassium 6.1,\nchloride 106, bicarb 15, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 103.\nCKs were 101, 84, and 82.  Troponin less then 0.3.  Calcium\n7.7, phos 3.4, magnesium 2.3.  Cortisol was sent off and came\nback at 14.  Coagulation studies revealed a PT of 14.5, PTT\n32.8, INR of 1.5.  Microbiology data still with a sputum gram\nstain 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters, 1+ gram\npositive rods.  No respiratory culture data as of yet.\n\nIn terms of the patient's pneumonia he was continued on Levo,\nFlagyl and Vancomycin.  White blood cell count was noted to\nbe up, however, the patient remained afebrile and his oxygen\nsaturation remained good on the nonrebreather.\n\nIn terms of his hypotension and sepsis, the decision was made\nto give the patient 1 liter of D5W with 3 amps of bicarb to\nbe repeated times two or three as needed for blood pressure\nsupport.  It was also decided to start the patient on high\ndose steroids Hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hours times three\ndoses.  There was discussion with the team whether the\npatient would be a candidate for activated protein C.  The\nconclusion was that the patient would possibly be a candidate\nand the team decided to wait to see how he did throughout the\nafternoon on the [**12-6**] before actually starting the\npatient on the activated protein C.\n\nIn terms of the patient's renal failure his creatinine was\n1.4 again the morning following his admission to the MICU.  A\nnotable increase from his baseline of .6.  It was felt that\nthis bump in his creatinine was due to hyperperfusion in the\nsetting of hypotension and the patient was given hydration as\nmentioned with 1 liter fluid boluses.  He was continued on\nLevofloxacin and Vancomycin at full dose as opposed to\nrenally dosing them given how sick he was.\n\nIn terms of his acid base status, the patient's bicarb was 16\non the morning following his admission to the MICU.  His\nlactate was up to 3.5.  His morning blood gas was 7.33, 34,\n87 indicating the patient was adequately compensating for his\nmetabolic acidosis.\n\nFrom a GI standpoint the patient was continued on Zantac.  In\nterms of prophylaxis the patient was put on subcutaneous\nheparin.  In terms of pain the patient was continued on\nToradol for his pleuritic chest pain.\n\nAt the time of this dictation, which is the [**12-7**] the\npatient has been off of his Levophed since 3:00 p.m. on [**2172-7-6**].  He has been approximately 24 hours off of Levophed\nand has been off Vasopressin for approximately a day and a\nhalf.  His laboratory data is much improved at the time of\nthis dictation.  His bicarb is up to 26.  His creatinine is\ndown to 0.9.  His blood pressure has been completely stable\nfollowing volume boluses, which have included a total of 2\nliters of D5W each with 3 amps of sodium bicarb.  He has had\nno temperature spikes and his O2 sats have been in high 90s\non a nonrebreather and ultimately on 4 liters nasal cannula.\n\nHis laboratory data is notable for a white blood cell count\nincrease to 17.9 in the setting of high dose steroids.\nHematocrit 30.9 in the setting of aggresive hydration.\nSodium 134, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, bicarb 26, BUN 18,\ncreatinine 0.9, glucose 109, calcium 7.8, magnesium 2.1, phos\n3.7, Cortisol 14, albumin 2.6.  The patient's microdata, only\nthe sputum gram stain is back with 4 positive gram positive\ncoxae in pairs and cultures.  Culture data is pending.  Blood\ncultures are no growth so far.\n\nFrom a pneumonia standpoint the patient is continued on broad\nspectrum antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Flagyl and\nVancomycin.  His respiratory status is significantly improved\nand he is on nasal cannula 4 liters.  He has not had any\ntemperature spikes during his stay in the Intensive Care\nUnit.\n\nFrom a hypotension/sepsis standpoint the patient's blood\npressures have been completely stable overnight as well as\nthe entire day on the [**7-6**].  He has been on pressors\nfor more then 24 hours.  His blood pressure is 99 to 122\nsystolic/65 to 80 diastolic.  The patient never received\nactivated protein C.  Instead he received broad spectrum\nantibiotics, fluid resuscitation and high dose steroids.\n\nFrom a renal standpoint his creatinine is trending down\nnicely to 0.9.  He is starting to mobilize his fluids and his\nrenal function appears to be improved.\n\nFrom an acid base standpoint it has lactated down today to\n1.9.  Arterial blood gas was 7.44, 51, 114, bicarb of 226\nyesterday afternoon and again this morning.  His acidosis has\nresoled.\n\nIn terms of hematologic, the patient's hematocrit is noted to\nbe 30.9 down from 33 in the setting of being approximately 3\nliters positive over the past 24 hours.  His admission\nhematocrit is noted to be 34, therefore we are checking iron\nstudies, LDH, haptoglobin, B-12 and folate levels.  The\npatient is without any known history of anemia.  His stools\nwill be guaiaced during the remainder of his hospital stay.\n\nIn terms of GI the patient was continued on Zantac.  His diet\nwill be advanced today as tolerated.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, the patient's\nelectrolytes were essentially within normal limits.  It was\nnoted that his albumin was decreased to 2.6, which seems\nsomewhat dramatic given that he has been without nutritional\nsupport for only two days.  It is now clear what his baseline\nalbumin is, but he looks like he is a well developed, well\nnourished gentleman and this may be something for his primary\ncare physician to follow up in the outpatient setting.\n\nIn terms of disposition the patient is full code.\n\nIn terms of access his right femoral and left arterial line\nwere both pulled without any adverse event on the [**2172-7-6**].  Communications have been with the patient's wife and\ndaughter who have been in the hospital for much of his\nhospital stay in the Intensive Care Unit.  The remainder of\nthe [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay including his discharge\nmedications will be dictated at the time of discharge.  He is\nbeing transferred to the medical floor on Vancomycin 1 gram q\n12 hours, Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day, Flagyl 500 mg po\nt.i.d., Zantac 50 mg po t.i.d., Albuterol and Atrovent\nnebulizers, Tylenol, Flovent, Serevent, Droperidol, aspirin\nand Prednisone 60 mg po q day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 1379**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29450**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2172-7-7**]  15:03\nT:  [**2172-7-7**]  15:26\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 42253**]",

PT 13.7, PTT 28.2, INR\n1.3.  AST is 10, alkaline phosphatase 53, total bili 0.9,\namylase 12, CK 101 with an MB of 1 and a troponin of less\nthen 0.3.  Imaging studies showed a chest CT, which shows\nbilateral lower lobe consolidations posteriorly.  There is a\nsmall right pleural effusion and a trace left pleural\neffusion.  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  There\nis a small subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes,\nprevascular, pretracheal and subcranial.  Electrocardiogram\nis notable for atrial fibrillation on initial presentation to\nthe Emergency Department with a rate of 126, axis 15 degrees,\nT wave inversion in lead 3, T wave flattening in AVF.  There\nis a Q wave in AVF.  Compared with a prior study form [**2165**]\natrial fibrillation and a T wave inversion in lead three are\nboth new findings.\n\nIn summary, this 73 year-old gentleman with a history of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma presents\nwith shortness of breath, right sided chest pain that is\npleuritic in nature as well as onset of shaking and chills on\nthe day of presentation to the Emergency Department.  He is\nfound to have bibasilar pneumonia by CT of the chest.\nHowever, the CT of the chest is not consistent with evidence\nof a pulmonary embolus.  The patient was initially admitted\nto the Medical Flor and treated for pneumonia.  He received\nintravenous Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency\nDepartment for empiric treatment of his pneumonia given his\nhistory of past aspiration pneumonia in the postoperative\nsetting.  Blood cultures were obtained in the Emergency\nDepartment.  The sputum culture was not obtained initially,\nbut was obtained later when the patient arrived on the\nmedical floor.  The patient was continued on non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs for his pleuritic chest pain as well\nas Toradol for pain control.\n\nIn terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation this was new in\nonset likely secondary to this pneumonia.  The patient's rate\nwas controlled with Diltiazem.  When the patient was\ntransferred to the medical floor he was noted to be in sinus\nrhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for his time on the\nmedical floor as well as for the duration of his stay in the\nIntensive Care Unit.\n\nIn terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the\npatient was continued on MDI and nebulizers.\n\nIn terms of GI the patient was put on Zantac.  He was also\nput initially on intravenous heparin when he was admitted to\nthe medical floor.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, he was put on\na house diet as tolerated with intravenous fluids until the\npatient was taking better po and his electrolytes were\nfollowed.\n\nThe patient on the [**12-5**] in the early evening at\napproximately 8:00 p.m. was noted to be hypotensive on the\nmedical floor with blood pressures 60s/40s and oxygen\nsaturation dropping from 86% on 2 liters increasing to 89 to\n90% on 5 liters.  He was then put on a 50% ventimask, which\nincreased his oxygenation to 93%.  Subsequently it dropped to\n91%.  The patient was then put on 50% face mask and his\noxygen saturation remained approximately 91%.  In the setting\nof his hypoxia as well as his hypotension the patient was\ntransferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further\nevaluation.  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nthe patient's blood pressure continued to be approximately\n50s to 60s systolic over 40s diastolic.  The patient was,\nhowever, mentating quite well throughout this period of\nhypotension.  He had a right femoral line placed on arrival\nto the Intensive Care Unit as well as a left arterial line\nplaced.  The patient was then started on Levophed at initial\ndose of 10 micrograms per minute as well as on Vasopressin as\ndose of 0.04 units per minute.  The patient was continued on\nthese pressors overnight for additional blood pressure\nsupport.  The patient also was treated with 2 liters of\nnormal saline run wide open for additional pressure support.\nThe patient was not responsive to the fluid resuscitation and\ntherefore did require the initiation of the pressors as\nmentioned.  The patient was continued on Levo, Flagyl and\nVancomycin was also started.\n\nThe patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found to\nbe not elevated.  His CK and troponin were both within the\nnormal range.  In terms of rhythm, the patient was not in\natrial fibrillation on transfer to the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit and remained in sinus rhythm during his stay in the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit.\n\nAs mentioned on the evening of admission he was hypotensive\nwith blood pressure 60s/40s.  Given his pneumonia and\nsignificant bandemia as well as a history of shakes and\nchills prior to admission it was felt that the patient was\nseptic.  He was put on pressors for blood pressure support,\ngiven fluid 2 liters as mentioned and he was continued on\nbroad spectrum antibiotics.  From a pulmonary standpoint he\nwas treated for the pneumonia as mentioned.  The heparin drip\nwas discontinued, because the patient had no evidence of a PE\non CTA.  He was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as\nwell as Flovent and Serevent given his history of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.  His blood gas on admission to\nthe MCI was 737, 29, 77.  From a GI standpoint the patient\nwas continued on Zantac.  From a renal FEN standpoint, the\npatient was NPO.  His potassium was repleted and intravenous\nfluids for initial level of 3.1.  It was noted that his\ncreatinine increased to 1.4 from 0.6 on admission likely\nsecondary to poor perfusion in the setting of hypotension.\nHis creatinine was followed closely every day.  From an\ninfectious disease standpoint the patient's sputum was sent\nfor culture.  Preliminary data showed 4+ gram positive coxae\nin pairs and clusters as well as 1+ gram positive rods.  At\nthe time of this dictation there is no additional data on\nrespiratory culture.  The patient's temperature max on the\nmedical floor was 100.  He did not spike a temperature during\nhis stay in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nOn the second day in the Intensive Care Unit on the morning\nfollowing his transfer the patient had remained on a\nnonrebreather with O2 sats in the high 90s overnight.  His\nLevophed was starting to be titrated down from 10 to 6 and\nultimately down to 3.  His Vasopressin was at 0.04 overnight\non the first evening in the Intensive Care Unit.  He also\nreceived q 2 hour nebulizers overnight.  Laboratory data on\nthe morning following his admission to the MICU included a\nwhite count increased to 11.2, hematocrit stable at 33.8,\nrepeat electrolytes showed a sodium of 134, potassium 6.1,\nchloride 106, bicarb 15, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 103.\nCKs were 101, 84, and 82.  Troponin less then 0.3.  Calcium\n7.7, phos 3.4, magnesium 2.3.  Cortisol was sent off and came\nback at 14.  Coagulation studies revealed a PT of 14.5, PTT\n32.8, INR of 1.5.  Microbiology data still with a sputum gram\nstain 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters, 1+ gram\npositive rods.  No respiratory culture data as of yet.\n\nIn terms of the patient's pneumonia he was continued on Levo,\nFlagyl and Vancomycin.  White blood cell count was noted to\nbe up, however, the patient remained afebrile and his oxygen\nsaturation remained good on the nonrebreather.\n\nIn terms of his hypotension and sepsis, the decision was made\nto give the patient 1 liter of D5W with 3 amps of bicarb to\nbe repeated times two or three as needed for blood pressure\nsupport.  It was also decided to start the patient on high\ndose steroids Hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hours times three\ndoses.  There was discussion with the team whether the\npatient would be a candidate for activated protein C.  The\nconclusion was that the patient would possibly be a candidate\nand the team decided to wait to see how he did throughout the\nafternoon on the [**12-6**] before actually starting the\npatient on the activated protein C.\n\nIn terms of the patient's renal failure his creatinine was\n1.4 again the morning following his admission to the MICU.  A\nnotable increase from his baseline of .6.  It was felt that\nthis bump in his creatinine was due to hyperperfusion in the\nsetting of hypotension and the patient was given hydration as\nmentioned with 1 liter fluid boluses.  He was continued on\nLevofloxacin and Vancomycin at full dose as opposed to\nrenally dosing them given how sick he was.\n\nIn terms of his acid base status, the patient's bicarb was 16\non the morning following his admission to the MICU.  His\nlactate was up to 3.5.  His morning blood gas was 7.33, 34,\n87 indicating the patient was adequately compensating for his\nmetabolic acidosis.\n\nFrom a GI standpoint the patient was continued on Zantac.  In\nterms of prophylaxis the patient was put on subcutaneous\nheparin.  In terms of pain the patient was continued on\nToradol for his pleuritic chest pain.\n\nAt the time of this dictation, which is the [**12-7**] the\npatient has been off of his Levophed since 3:00 p.m. on [**2172-7-6**].  He has been approximately 24 hours off of Levophed\nand has been off Vasopressin for approximately a day and a\nhalf.  His laboratory data is much improved at the time of\nthis dictation.  His bicarb is up to 26.  His creatinine is\ndown to 0.9.  His blood pressure has been completely stable\nfollowing volume boluses, which have included a total of 2\nliters of D5W each with 3 amps of sodium bicarb.  He has had\nno temperature spikes and his O2 sats have been in high 90s\non a nonrebreather and ultimately on 4 liters nasal cannula.\n\nHis laboratory data is notable for a white blood cell count\nincrease to 17.9 in the setting of high dose steroids.\nHematocrit 30.9 in the setting of aggresive hydration.\nSodium 134, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, bicarb 26, BUN 18,\ncreatinine 0.9, glucose 109, calcium 7.8, magnesium 2.1, phos\n3.7, Cortisol 14, albumin 2.6.  The patient's microdata, only\nthe sputum gram stain is back with 4 positive gram positive\ncoxae in pairs and cultures.  Culture data is pending.  Blood\ncultures are no growth so far.\n\nFrom a pneumonia standpoint the patient is continued on broad\nspectrum antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Flagyl and\nVancomycin.  His respiratory status is significantly improved\nand he is on nasal cannula 4 liters.  He has not had any\ntemperature spikes during his stay in the Intensive Care\nUnit.\n\nFrom a hypotension/sepsis standpoint the patient's blood\npressures have been completely stable overnight as well as\nthe entire day on the [**7-6**].  He has been on pressors\nfor more then 24 hours.  His blood pressure is 99 to 122\nsystolic/65 to 80 diastolic.  The patient never received\nactivated protein C.  Instead he received broad spectrum\nantibiotics, fluid resuscitation and high dose steroids.\n\nFrom a renal standpoint his creatinine is trending down\nnicely to 0.9.  He is starting to mobilize his fluids and his\nrenal function appears to be improved.\n\nFrom an acid base standpoint it has lactated down today to\n1.9.  Arterial blood gas was 7.44, 51, 114, bicarb of 226\nyesterday afternoon and again this morning.  His acidosis has\nresoled.\n\nIn terms of hematologic, the patient's hematocrit is noted to\nbe 30.9 down from 33 in the setting of being approximately 3\nliters positive over the past 24 hours.  His admission\nhematocrit is noted to be 34, therefore we are checking iron\nstudies, LDH, haptoglobin, B-12 and folate levels.  The\npatient is without any known history of anemia.  His stools\nwill be guaiaced during the remainder of his hospital stay.\n\nIn terms of GI the patient was continued on Zantac.  His diet\nwill be advanced today as tolerated.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, the patient's\nelectrolytes were essentially within normal limits.  It was\nnoted that his albumin was decreased to 2.6, which seems\nsomewhat dramatic given that he has been without nutritional\nsupport for only two days.  It is now clear what his baseline\nalbumin is, but he looks like he is a well developed, well\nnourished gentleman and this may be something for his primary\ncare physician to follow up in the outpatient setting.\n\nIn terms of disposition the patient is full code.\n\nIn terms of access his right femoral and left arterial line\nwere both pulled without any adverse event on the [**2172-7-6**].  Communications have been with the patient's wife and\ndaughter who have been in the hospital for much of his\nhospital stay in the Intensive Care Unit.  The remainder of\nthe [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay including his discharge\nmedications will be dictated at the time of discharge.  He is\nbeing transferred to the medical floor on Vancomycin 1 gram q\n12 hours, Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day, Flagyl 500 mg po\nt.i.d., Zantac 50 mg po t.i.d., Albuterol and Atrovent\nnebulizers, Tylenol, Flovent, Serevent, Droperidol, aspirin\nand Prednisone 60 mg po q day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 1379**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29450**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2172-7-7**]  15:03\nT:  [**2172-7-7**]  15:26\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 42253**]\n\nYou are an expert clinician.

HEMATOLOGY/ONCOLOGY ISSUES:  The patient received\nhigh-dose methotrexate per protocol.  Methotrexate levels\nwere followed.  Her methotrexate levels were 3.55 on [**2153-7-11**],\nand 0.27 on [**2153-7-12**], and 0.1 on [**2153-7-13**], and 0.05 on [**2153-7-14**].\nHer urine was alkalized with bicarbonate and urine pH was checked\nregularly and noted to be 7 and above.\n\nA neurosurgery consultation was obtained for correction of her\nOmmaya reservoir as prior imaging demonstrated the catheter tip\nincorrectly located in the left basal ganglia.  The patient\nunderwent correction of her shunt on Friday, [**2153-7-13**].\n\nHer postoperative course was complicated by a retro-orbital\nhematoma.  A computed tomography of the head demonstrated a soft\ntissue density displacing the superior rectus and optic nerve\ninferiorly and causing proptosis as well as multisinus disease. A\nfollow-up magnetic resonance imaging study demonstrated the new\nleft-sided extraconal mass at the superior portion of the left\norbit; consistent with acute hematoma as well as enhancing\nmeningeal disease in the left frontal lobe with no evidence of\nhydrocephalus.\n\nAn ophthalmology consultation was obtained and felt all of the\npatient's changes in vision and examination were consistent with\npost surgical hematoma.  There was no evidence of compartment\nsyndrome.  Her vision did not worsen during the remainder of her\nhospital course.\n\nA Radiation Oncology consultation was obtained and evaluated the\npatient.  They also felt that the patient's proptosis and visual\nchanges were all most likely secondary to a hematoma rather a\nneoplastic process.\n\n2.  INFECTIOUS DISEASE ISSUES:  The patient was noted to have\na fever with intermittent spikes in temperature to as high as\n101.4 degrees Fahrenheit.  It lasted only several hours.  The\nfevers began on Friday ([**2153-7-13**]) and continued through Sunday\n([**2153-7-15**]).  All cultures remained negative.\n\n3.  CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM:  The patient was continued on her\nregimen of metoprolol and was not given anticoagulation given\nher neurosurgery during admission.\n\n4.  PULMONARY ISSUES:  The patient was continued on her\noutpatient regimen of Serevent and albuterol inhalers.\n\n5.  FLUIDS/ELECTROLYTES/NUTRITION ISSUES:  The patient took oral\nintake as tolerated, and electrolytes were repleted as required.\n\n6. GENITOURINARY SYSTEM:  The patient had new onset of\nincontinence following her neurosurgical procedure.  The cause of\nthis new onset of incontinence was not clear; however, the\nincontinence was transient and resolved prior to discharge.\n\nCONDITION AT DISCHARGE:  The patient was discharged in stable\ncondition.\n\nYou are an expert clinician.

There is no information about the patient's current or past use, so the status is neither present nor past.\nLabel: Present\nReasoning: The patient currently uses alcohol as per the statement \"alcohol [3-10] drinks per month\" which indicates they are currently using it.\nLabel: Present\n\nWait, but the first sentence is \"No tobacco, occasional alcohol [3-10] drinks per month, retired systems engineer.\" So the presence of \"alcohol\" is mentioned, but the statement about the number of drinks and the fact that they are a retired engineer. However, the key here is that the label needs to be based on the presence of the use. The text says \"alcohol\" is mentioned, so it's a current use. But the exact wording is \"alcohol [3-10] drinks per month\". Therefore, the answer should be Present. But the first response said Present, and the second said Present again. Wait, but the user's answer needs to be in the correct format with two sentences. Let me check again.\n\nOriginal text: \"No"

Well, the current status is about her current use. Since she's not drinking, even if she quit, the current use is not present. So the answer should be None because she doesn't use alcohol now.

The patient's social history says they're an ex-smoker who quit in 2160. They also mention they are occasional caffeine users but deny using alcohol. The location is in NH with their wife and works as a logistics manager. Since they don't use alcohol at all, the answer should be None. The reasoning is straightforward: they don't use alcohol, so the label is none. I don't see any other possibilities here.\nAnswer:\nReasoning: The text indicates the patient is an ex-smoker who quit in 2160 and denies alcohol use.

The patient says they deny tobacco use, but they are IVDA/Heroin. Then it mentions Past h/o marijuana and cocaine. Also, they have a history of ETOH abuse, stopped after chronic pancreatitis diagnosed. Lives with a mother.\n\nSo, the key here is to determine if the patient is currently using alcohol. The mention of IVDA/Heroin is direct, which suggests they are currently using alcohol. The other information about past use and stopping after a specific time also indicates they used it in the past. The label needs to reflect whether they are currently using, past, or none.\n\nThe patient is currently using alcohol as IVDA/Heroin. Even though they have a history of past use, the current status is still present. So the label should be Present. The reasoning is that they are currently using alcohol, not in the past. The reasoning is that the current use is explicitly stated, and the history of past use doesn't negate it. So the answer is Present.\nAnswer:\nReasoning: The patient is currently using alcohol as IV"

However, the label \"Present\" implies they are currently using alcohol. Since the text does not explicitly state they are currently using alcohol, it is possible they are not. But the label \"Present\" might be correct if the absence of smoking implies they are not using it. However, the exact status is not clear. The most accurate label is Present because the absence of smoking in 5-20 years might indicate they are not currently using alcohol, but the text doesn't explicitly state they are. The reasoning is that the text doesn't provide enough information to confirm current use. Hence, the label is Present.\nReasoning: The patient has a history of tobacco, but has not smoked in approximately 5-20 years, which suggests they may have smoked in the past but stopped.

The text provided is about a patient. The patient is a Chinese citizen with an associate degree and speaks English. They have a mother who is giving them psych meds. The psychiatrist's pager number is mentioned as 60312. \n\nSo, the question is about whether the patient uses alcohol. The text doesn't mention anything about alcohol use. It talks about their education, their mother's role in giving psych meds, and the psychiatrist's pager. There's no information provided about the patient's current or past alcohol use. \n\nTherefore, based on the given text, the patient isn't described as a current or past user of alcohol. The labels should be \"None\" here. The reasoning is straightforward because there's no mention of alcohol in the text.

The patient's social history says they don't smoke, drink one drink a month, have no history of cocaine or IV drug use, live with his wife and kids, and is a mutual fund manager. Now, the question is about alcohol use. The key here is to determine if they use alcohol currently, in the past, or neither.\n\nThe text mentions they drink one drink a month. That's a regular activity. But does that mean they are currently using alcohol? Well, if they drink alcohol, that would be a current use. But the wording is \"drinks one drink per month\" and \"has no history of cocaine or IV drug use.\" The presence of a monthly drinking habit might indicate they are currently using alcohol, but maybe they are not. However, the label has to be based on the information given. Since there's no mention of past use, just current activity, it's more likely they are currently using alcohol. But wait, maybe the \"has no history of cocaine or IV drug use\" implies that they are not using drugs, but that doesn't directly relate to alcohol. The answer should"

Since the text says they \"use alcohol\" but doesn't mention their current use, it's possible they used it in the past but not currently. However, the labels have to be one of the three. The presence of \"uses alcohol\" indicates they are currently using it, so the label should be Present. But wait, maybe the text doesn't specify if they are using it now. The answer depends on the interpretation. Since the text doesn't mention their current use, but states they \"use alcohol,\" it's a bit ambiguous.

No evidence of intracranial\nhemorrhage or mass effect was noted. Head MRI was done as\nwell with and without contrast. This demonstrated mild age\ninappropriate prominence of the sulci and ventricles. No\nacute infarct was noted. No mass effect or hydrocephalus was\nnoted. No abnormal enhancement was noted. Altered mental\nstatus was attributed to steroids and his prednisone was\ndecreased on postoperative day 10 to 15 mg.

He did not have an expressive or\nreceptive dysphagia. It was expected that the patient's\ncommunication abilities would return to baseline once medical\nissues were resolved. Given concerns for multifactorial\nconfusion secondary to increased creatinine and decreased\nsodium, he did undergo a hemodialysis briefly on [**2118-5-10**]. His sodium remained in the 127 range.

Physical\ntherapy worked with him initially recommending rehab but with\nimprovement in mental status. It was felt that the patient\nwould be safe to be discharged to home or to family member's\nhome. He was ambulatory in the hallway with supervision.\n\nThe patient experienced significant weight gain and pedal\nedema. This was treated with IV Lasix with improvement of\nedema. He was switched to Lasix 20 mg PO once daily. His\nweight dropped down to 100.3 from preoperative weight of\n114.1. He had two JP drains. These were removed and sutured\nand he experienced large volume output from the medial JP up\nto 2 liters per day. The JP drain was removed and the site\nsutured without further leaking his incision. A duplex of the\nabdomen was done on [**5-10**]. Patent hepatic and portal\nvessels were noted.  Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive\nstudies were done to evaluate edema. This was done on [**5-17**]. There was no evidence of DVT.\n\nOn [**5-18**], a post-pyloric bleeding tube was placed for\nconcerns that the patient would not be able to meet his\ncaloric intake need. Unfortunately the patient pulled out his\npost-pyloric feeding tube during the night. This was not\nreplaced given improved mental status. The patient was taking\nin at least 1800 Kcal the following day. Improved mental\nstatus was attributed to less steroids given.\n\nIn summary, the patient has been in stable condition,\nambulatory, tolerating a regular diet, his incision clips\nwere opened at the top of the incision in his left lateral\nside for leaking of serosanguineous drainage. Normal saline\ndamp to dry dressings were placed on the open areas b.i.d.\nHis liver function tests improved with an AST of 22, ALT of\n39, alkaline phosphatase 75, and total bilirubin of 0.8,\ncreatinine was down at 1.9. His hematocrit was stable in the\nrange of 25.2 to 27.3. Platelet count was 114. He continued\non immunosuppression with CellCept, prednisone and Prograf\nwhich was adjusted. This was titrated to 1 mg PO b.i.d for a\nlevel of 17.9.\n\nPlan was to send the patient home and not to rehab given\nimproved mental status.

His sodium gradually\nimproved up to 132 with improvement in his creatinine to 1.9\nwithout dialysis.\n\nDue to poor PO intake, a nutrition consult was obtained. TPN\nwas started. [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained for management of\nhyperglycemia with improvement in mental status. The\npatient's oral intake improved and TPN was stopped. Physical\ntherapy worked with him initially recommending rehab but with\nimprovement in mental status. It was felt that the patient\nwould be safe to be discharged to home or to family member's\nhome. He was ambulatory in the hallway with supervision.\n\nThe patient experienced significant weight gain and pedal\nedema. This was treated with IV Lasix with improvement of\nedema. He was switched to Lasix 20 mg PO once daily. His\nweight dropped down to 100.3 from preoperative weight of\n114.1. He had two JP drains. These were removed and sutured\nand he experienced large volume output from the medial JP up\nto 2 liters per day. The JP drain was removed and the site\nsutured without further leaking his incision. A duplex of the\nabdomen was done on [**5-10**]. Patent hepatic and portal\nvessels were noted.  Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive\nstudies were done to evaluate edema. This was done on [**5-17**]. There was no evidence of DVT.\n\nOn [**5-18**], a post-pyloric bleeding tube was placed for\nconcerns that the patient would not be able to meet his\ncaloric intake need. Unfortunately the patient pulled out his\npost-pyloric feeding tube during the night. This was not\nreplaced given improved mental status. The patient was taking\nin at least 1800 Kcal the following day. Improved mental\nstatus was attributed to less steroids given.\n\nIn summary, the patient has been in stable condition,\nambulatory, tolerating a regular diet, his incision clips\nwere opened at the top of the incision in his left lateral\nside for leaking of serosanguineous drainage. Normal saline\ndamp to dry dressings were placed on the open areas b.i.d.\nHis liver function tests improved with an AST of 22, ALT of\n39, alkaline phosphatase 75, and total bilirubin of 0.8,\ncreatinine was down at 1.9. His hematocrit was stable in the\nrange of 25.2 to 27.3. Platelet count was 114. He continued\non immunosuppression with CellCept, prednisone and Prograf\nwhich was adjusted. This was titrated to 1 mg PO b.i.d for a\nlevel of 17.9.\n\nPlan was to send the patient home and not to rehab given\nimproved mental status. It is anticipated that he will be\ndischarged home to his brother's home with follow up in the\noutpatient clinic.\n\nYou are an expert clinician.

Let me check again.\n\nThe text says: \"occasional alcohol.\" The term \"occasional\" usually means that they use alcohol at times, but not regularly. So, it's a past use.

The patient's social history text says they exercise six days a week and live alone. They also mention careful with their diet. Then there's a list for tobacco and alcohol. The key part here is that the alcohol section says \"Previously heavy drinker, now 1-2 beers/day.\" So the patient has a history of alcohol use, but it's not clear if they are currently using it or not. The label needs to be either Present, Past, or None. Since the text states they used alcohol before but no longer, but doesn't specify if they are currently using it. However, the answer options don't include \"never\" or \"never used,\" so it's a bit ambiguous. But the presence of \"now 1-2 beers/day\" suggests a current use, but the exact status isn't clear. Wait, the label has to be one of the three. Since they mention \"now\" after the past, but the exact status isn't fully specified. But maybe \"Present\" is the correct label because they are currently using it. Alternatively, \"None\" if there's no mention. But the text says \"now 1-2 beers/day,\" which implies current use.

Since the patient does not currently use alcohol, the status is \"Present\" if they are using it, \"Past\" if they used it in the past, or \"None\" if there's no mention of current or past use.
