In general,\nthe patient was a well-nourished gentleman in no acute\ndistress.  Cardiovascular examination revealed a regular rate\nand rhythm.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops.  The lungs were\nclear to auscultation bilaterally.  The abdomen was\ntympanitic and distended, mildly tender in the right upper\nquadrant, with no rebound or guarding.  Extremity examination\nrevealed no clubbing, cyanosis, or edema.  Neurologic\nexamination was grossly nonfocal.  Cranial nerves II through\nXII were intact.\n\nBRIEF SUMMARY OF HOSPITAL COURSE BY ISSUE/SYSTEM:   The\npatient was admitted to the Medical Intensive Care Unit.\n\n1.  GASTROINTESTINAL BLEED ISSUES:  The patient was\ntransfused multiple units of packed red blood cells and fresh\nfrozen plasma.  The patient's Coumadin was held.  His INR was\n2.5 on admission.

A nasogastric lavage was\nrepeated which showed coffee-grounds followed by fresh clots\nof red blood.\n\nThe patient was sent to Interventional Radiology for an\nangioembolization.  An angioembolization was done to the\ngastroduodenal artery on [**7-25**].  This procedure was\ncomplicated with a right groin hematoma.\n\nOn [**7-26**], the patient's hematocrit was still slowly\ndropping.  Interventional Radiology and Surgery were\nconsulted again.  The patient was sent for a repeat\nembolization on [**7-28**].  This embolization was\ncomplicated with a left groin hematoma and pseudoaneurysm.\n\nFollowing the second angioembolization, the patient's\nhematocrit remained stable for 24 hours, and he was\ntransferred to the medicine floor from the unit.  The patient\nreceived a total of 14 units of packed red blood cells and 10\nunits of fresh frozen plasma in the unit.

The patient\nreceived 2 units of packed red blood cells, and 2 units of\nfresh frozen plasma, and 1 mg of intravenous vitamin K.\n\nVascular Surgery was consulted again, and the patient was to\ngo for repair of the left femoral pseudoaneurysm.  The\npatient's hematocrit was stable for the next three days at\napproximately 32.  His INR was corrected to 1.3.\n\nOn [**8-3**], the patient was taken to the operating room\nfor pseudoaneurysm repair.  On [**8-4**], the patient was\nfound to still have a slowly dropping hematocrit once again.\nHe was transfused one unit of packed red blood cells.

CARDIOVASCULAR ISSUES:  The patient was ventricularly\npaced, and therefore ischemia was unable to be evaluated\nbased on his electrocardiogram in the Emergency Department.\nThe patient ruled out for a myocardial infarction, and his\nantihypertensive medications were held.  The patient's blood\npressure remained stable throughout his hospitalization.\n\n3.  GASTROINTESTINAL ISSUES:  The patient has a history of\nchronic constipation.

The\npatient had regular bowel movements after being transferred\nto the floor and did not have any further gastrointestinal\ncomplaints.  The patient was also started on Viokase with\nmeals for possible pancreatic dysfunction.\n\n4.  COAGULOPATHY ISSUES:  The patient was initially admitted\non Coumadin with an INR of 2.5 following reversal of\nanticoagulation with fresh frozen plasma and vitamin K  while\nthe patient was in the Medical Intensive Care Unit.

The patient again\nreceived 2 more units of fresh frozen plasma and 1 mg of\nintravenous vitamin K while on the floor and then placed on\noral vitamin K to maintain his INR at less than 1.5.  The\npatient was discharged with an INR of 1.3 which remained\nstable following the initial reversal with fresh frozen\nplasma and vitamin K.\n\n5.

It showed no acute intracranial hemorrhage, and\ntissue loss noted in the left thalamus consistent with his\nold known hemorrhagic stroke.\nUltrasound of his right upper extremity done [**2146-12-12**] for\nedematous right arm showed nonocclusive clot within the right\nIJ and one of his two brachial veins thrombosed.\n\nHOSPITAL COURSE FROM [**0-0-0**]:  This is a\n[**Age over 90 **]-year-old male, with a history of chronic diarrhea, past\nhemorrhagic CVA, who was admitted to the [**Hospital Ward Name 12573**] Intensive\nCare Unit with an aspiration pneumonia after vomiting, and\nsubsequent development of sepsis and respiratory failure.\nPostextubation, it was noted that the patient had new left\nleg weakness and left facial droop with new dysarthria.\n\n1) SEPTIC SHOCK:  This was likely secondary to a SIRS\nreaction, status post severe aspiration pneumonia and\npneumonitis.  The patient was admitted on the MUST sepsis\nprotocol.  During his first hospital day, he was hypotensive\nand required both Levophed and vasopressin to keep his mean\narterial pressure greater than 65, his lactic acidosis peaked\nwith a lactate level of 6.0, and he was placed on a\nbicarbonate drip in the setting of both nongap and anion gap\nacidosis.  He also required an insulin drip.  His cortisol\nstimulation test was negative with a baseline cortisol of 100\nin the setting of his sepsis which is an appropriate\nresponse.  His aspiration pneumonia was treated with a 9-day\ncourse of ceftazidime, vancomycin and Flagyl to cover\nnosocomial aspiration.  The vancomycin was switched to\noxacillin after sensitivities came back on a Staph aureus\nthat grew out of his sputum that showed it to be sensitive to\noxacillin.\n\nThe patient improved rapidly after his early intervention in\nsepsis therapy and was weaned off vasopressors by hospital\nday #2.  He completed the remainder of his antibiotic course\nand did not have any further temperature spikes for the\nremainder of his ICU course.\n\n2) RESPIRATORY FAILURE:  The patient required intubation for\nrespiratory distress in the setting of acute aspiration\npneumonia and pneumonitis, as well as increased respiratory\ndrive from two metabolic acidosis processes.  He was able to\nbe quickly weaned off his ventilator, as his sepsis also\nrapidly improved.  He was extubated on [**2146-12-8**] after some\ndiuresis to remove volume that had been given during his\nacute sepsis.  He remained extubated and has gradually had\nimproving pulmonary toilet over the past few days.  The\npatient is currently on a scoop mask with 12 liters of flow\nand has had stable O2 sats of 95% or greater since then.\n\n3) NEUROLOGIC:  After extubation, it became apparent that Mr.\n[**Known lastname 12574**] had a new left-sided facial droop, dysarthria,\ndysphagia, and left leg weakness.  A head CT done to rule out\nany acute bleed was negative and showed only has old known\nhemorrhagic infarct, as well as multiple lacunar events.  His\nneurologic deficits have been gradually improving over the\npast few days, and currently his dysarthria is much improved.\nHe has 3/5 strength to the muscles in his left leg, and has\n4/5 strength to muscles in his left arm, and his facial droop\nis also improved.  He currently is requiring NG tube for\nfeeding, as he has failed his speech and swallow evaluation.\nThe plan will be to reevaluate him on Monday, [**12-19**], to\nsee if his swallowing has improved with his improved\ndysarthria.  He will be continued on an aspirin a day for\nstroke prophylaxis.  It is likely that this stroke occurred\nin the setting of low-flow during his hypotensive episodes.\n\n4) GI BLEEDING:  Upon admission, the patient had guaiac\npositive NG output and stool, although there was no gross\nblood, melena or coffee grounds from this output.  He did\nhave a total of 3 units of packed RBCs during his\nhospitalization with a hematocrit drop from 34 down to 26,\nand 3 units of blood required to get him above 30.  He was\ninitially started on Protonix and sucralfate for presumed\nstress gastritis.  After this intervention, he had no further\nsigns of GI bleeding, and his hematocrit has remained stable\nsince [**2146-12-7**].  He was then changed to lansoprazole\ntherapy only.\n\n5) CHRONIC DIARRHEA:  The patient did not have diarrhea while\nNPO, and his diarrhea restarted in the setting of his tube\nfeeds.  He had no further nausea or vomiting on admission.\nCultures of his stool were negative.  C. difficile x 3 was\nnegative.  Stool Osm gap was also nondiagnostic.  He was seen\nby his outpatient gastroenterologist, Dr. [**Last Name (STitle) 12575**], during this\nhospitalization who feels that he will perform a flexible\nsigmoidoscopy when his respiratory status is improved.  We\nwill currently continue Pepto-Bismol for symptomatic relief.\nCurrent output is about 200 cc/D of stool.\n\n6) METABOLIC ACIDOSIS:  The patient had both a lactic\nacidosis and a nonanion gap acidosis on admission.  His\nlactic acidosis was from his sepsis, and his nonanion gap\nacidosis was likely from chronic diarrhea.  These both\nimproved with hydration and the bicarb drip, and are not\ncurrently an issue.\n\n7) ACUTE RENAL FAILURE:  This occurred also in the setting of\nsepsis and hypotension.  This has resolved to the patient's\nbaseline creatinine after IV hydration, as well.\n\n8) NON-ST ELEVATION MI:  The patient ruled in after admission\nwith a peak troponin of 0.2.  His CKs and MBs were never\npositive.  This was likely a demand ischemia event in the\nsetting of sepsis.  He had his aspirin restarted and was kept\non beta blocker when his blood pressure tolerated this.  He\nhas had no signs of GI bleeding on the aspirin at this time.\n\n9) RIGHT ARM VENOUS CLOT:  This occurred in the setting of a\nright IJ central line.  The central line was pulled, and the\npatient is now on Lovenox and Coumadin.  The plan is to\nanticoagulate for 1 month in the setting of known intravenous\nprecipitant for the clot.  Edema of the right arm is now\nresolved.\n\n10) ENDOCRINE:  The patient has no known history of diabetes,\nbut has had increased blood sugars this entire\nhospitalization, even after the sepsis has resolved.  He was\ninitially on insulin drip, and has now been converted to\ninsulin sliding scale.  He will likely need to be converted\nto oral insulin therapy upon discharge.\n\n11) FLUIDS, ELECTROLYTES AND NUTRITION:  The patient has been\nmaintained on Criticare tube feeds as a low-residue,\nlow-osmolar formula to help decrease his diarrhea.  His\nvolume status is currently still volume overloaded, and he is\nbeing actively diuresed with lasix 40 mg IV bid.  His volume\nstatus should be assessed daily for adjustment of this and\nconversion to PO lasix.  Replete potassium to be greater than\n4, and magnesium to be greater than 2.\n\n12) ACCESS:  The patient has poor IV access after his right\nIJ was discontinued.  He had a left midline PICC placed by IV\ntherapy on [**2146-12-14**] for purposes of blood draws, intravenous\nlasix, and labs.\n\n13) HYPERTENSION:  This is well-controlled on current\nLopressor, ACE inhibitor and Norvasc doses.\n\n14) PROPHYLAXIS:  The patient is on lansoprazole for GI\nprophylaxis and Risperdal 0.5 mg q hs for sleeping\nmedication.  Communication daily with son, [**Name (NI) **], and his\nwife.\n\nDISPOSITION:  The patient will be discharged to the medicine\nteam on the floor today to the geriatric service.  He is\ncurrently also being screened for rehab versus return to\n[**Hospital 100**] Rehab after improvement in his pulmonary toilets on\nthe floor.\n\nDNR STATUS:  The patient is Do Not Resuscitate, but he would\nlike to be intubated in the event of respiratory\nfailure.",

Respiratory for hypoxic respiratory failure.  The patient\nwas continued on mechanical ventilation with low tidal\nvolumes and pressures with PEEP for presumed adult\nrespiratory distress syndrome.  He was treated with albuterol\nand Atrovent MDIs as necessary.  A bronchoscopy was performed\nwhich revealed nonspecific changes.  The patient's ventilator\nsettings were adjusted as necessary to maintain stable oxygen\nsaturations and minimize pressures.  Despite multiple\nattempts to decrease the patient's sedation and attempt to\nwean the patient from the ventilator, the patient was unable\nto be weaned from the ventilator as of [**2145-2-25**].\n\n2.  Infectious Disease:  For the patient's pneumonia, he was\nbegun on Ceftriaxone and vancomycin initially.  This was then\nchanged to Levaquin.  Multiple cultures were sent including a\nbronchoscopy sample which was negative for pneumocystis and\nlegionella and positive for [**Female First Name (un) **] albicans.  Multiple blood\ncultures and sputum cultures were negative.  The patient was\ncontinued on Levaquin as described above.  On [**2145-2-14**],\nthe patient was hypotensive and hypothermic and was felt to\nbe septic and a question of vent acquired pneumonia was\nraised.  The patient was then resumed on vancomycin and\nCeftriaxone for presumed vent acquired pneumonia.  The\npatient continued to have temperatures and despite multiple\ncultures and changing of access lines, the patient's cultures\nremained negative.  Antibiotics were continued.\n\n3.  Cardiovascular:  Hypotension:  The patient's hemodynamics\nwere aggressively monitored.  He was given intravenous fluids\nas necessary for hypotension.  Eventually the patient\nrequired blood pressure support with pressors.  These were\nrequired intermittently.  During the week of [**2145-2-21**],\nthe patient's pressor requirement remained high requiring\nlarge doses of Neo-Synephrine which were unable to be weaned\npreviously in the patient's course, his pressor requirement\nwas intermittent but during the days between [**2-21**] and\n[**2-25**], the patient's pressor requirements remained steady\nand high and he was unable to be weaned to lower doses.\n\n4.  Atrial fibrillation:  The patient developed periods of\natrial fibrillation throughout the course of the\nhospitalization.  Initially these were responsive to\ndiltiazem or spontaneously converted on their own.  One\nepisode was associated with hypotension and the patient was\nattempted for DC cardioversion.  He did not respond to this\nand an amiodarone drip was started along with blood pressure\nsupport from pressors.  The patient spontaneously converted\non this.  He was then maintained on amiodarone po.  He\nsuffered from one additional atrial fibrillation episode.  An\namiodarone drip was started again and the patient was\nreturned to amiodarone po.  He was also seen in consultation\nby the Cardiology Service who recommended amiodarone\nintravenous and po, as was executed.\n\n5.  Endocrine:  Given the patient's pressor requirements, it\nwas presumed that the patient was potentially adrenally\ninsufficient and would benefit from steroids.  He was\nmaintained on intravenous hydrocortisone throughout the\ncourse of the admission.\n\n6.  Fluid status:  The patient received large amounts of\nintravenous fluids to support his blood pressure throughout\nthe admission.  He was ultimately 22 liters positive for the\nlength of stay.  By [**2145-2-25**], attempts to diurese the\npatient with Lasix were met with hypotension and episodes of\natrial fibrillation as described above.  The patient's\nintravenous medications were double concentrated in order to\nminimize the patient's intravenous input, however, attempts\nto remove fluid were unsuccessful as described above.\n\n7.  Access:  The patient received central lines for\nadministration of intravenous medications and arterial lines\nfor hemodynamic monitoring.  On [**2145-2-19**], during a\nroutine change of the patient's central line for question\ninfection, the patient suffered a complication of internal\njugular catheter placement.  He had a tension pneumothorax\nwith hypotension and decreased oxygen saturations.  Needle\nthoracostomy was performed immediately and the patient's\nblood pressure returned.  A chest tube was placed thereafter.\nThe patient's family was informed of these complications and\nhe suffered no further complications from the chest tube.\n\n8.  Disposition:  During the week of [**2145-2-21**], it\nbecame apparent that the patient's prognosis was poor, that\nmultiple attempts to decrease sedation, ventilatory support\nand pressors were unsuccessful.  The patient's family felt\nthat the patient would not want to live with this degree of\nlife support and began discussions regarding withdrawal of\ncare.  One of the patient's sons, however, was in\ndisagreement regarding this plan.  Talks continued and\nultimately on [**2145-2-24**], the patient's family was in\nagreement that the patient should be \"Do Not Resuscitate\" and\nthey intended to withdrawal care the following day.  On [**2145-2-25**], the patient's family came to the Medical Intensive\nCare Unit and agreed to withdrawal care from the patient.\n\nAt approximately 10:30 in the morning, the patient's life\nsupport was discontinued.  The patient was extubated and\npressors were turned off.  He was kept comfortable with\nmorphine drip and bolus along with intravenous Ativan.  The\npatient's vital signs declined throughout the remaining\ncourse of the day.  The patient appeared with comfortable\nwith measures taken.

Imaging studies showed a chest CT, which shows\nbilateral lower lobe consolidations posteriorly.  There is a\nsmall right pleural effusion and a trace left pleural\neffusion.  There is no evidence of pulmonary embolus.  There\nis a small subcentimeter bilateral hilar lymph nodes,\nprevascular, pretracheal and subcranial.  Electrocardiogram\nis notable for atrial fibrillation on initial presentation to\nthe Emergency Department with a rate of 126, axis 15 degrees,\nT wave inversion in lead 3, T wave flattening in AVF.  There\nis a Q wave in AVF.  Compared with a prior study form [**2165**]\natrial fibrillation and a T wave inversion in lead three are\nboth new findings.\n\nIn summary, this 73 year-old gentleman with a history of\nchronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma presents\nwith shortness of breath, right sided chest pain that is\npleuritic in nature as well as onset of shaking and chills on\nthe day of presentation to the Emergency Department.  He is\nfound to have bibasilar pneumonia by CT of the chest.\nHowever, the CT of the chest is not consistent with evidence\nof a pulmonary embolus.  The patient was initially admitted\nto the Medical Flor and treated for pneumonia.  He received\nintravenous Levofloxacin and Flagyl in the Emergency\nDepartment for empiric treatment of his pneumonia given his\nhistory of past aspiration pneumonia in the postoperative\nsetting.  Blood cultures were obtained in the Emergency\nDepartment.  The sputum culture was not obtained initially,\nbut was obtained later when the patient arrived on the\nmedical floor.  The patient was continued on non-steroidal\nanti-inflammatory drugs for his pleuritic chest pain as well\nas Toradol for pain control.\n\nIn terms of the patient's atrial fibrillation this was new in\nonset likely secondary to this pneumonia.  The patient's rate\nwas controlled with Diltiazem.  When the patient was\ntransferred to the medical floor he was noted to be in sinus\nrhythm and remained in sinus rhythm for his time on the\nmedical floor as well as for the duration of his stay in the\nIntensive Care Unit.\n\nIn terms of his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the\npatient was continued on MDI and nebulizers.\n\nIn terms of GI the patient was put on Zantac.  He was also\nput initially on intravenous heparin when he was admitted to\nthe medical floor.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, he was put on\na house diet as tolerated with intravenous fluids until the\npatient was taking better po and his electrolytes were\nfollowed.\n\nThe patient on the [**12-5**] in the early evening at\napproximately 8:00 p.m. was noted to be hypotensive on the\nmedical floor with blood pressures 60s/40s and oxygen\nsaturation dropping from 86% on 2 liters increasing to 89 to\n90% on 5 liters.  He was then put on a 50% ventimask, which\nincreased his oxygenation to 93%.  Subsequently it dropped to\n91%.  The patient was then put on 50% face mask and his\noxygen saturation remained approximately 91%.  In the setting\nof his hypoxia as well as his hypotension the patient was\ntransferred to the Medical Intensive Care Unit for further\nevaluation.  On arrival to the Medical Intensive Care Unit\nthe patient's blood pressure continued to be approximately\n50s to 60s systolic over 40s diastolic.  The patient was,\nhowever, mentating quite well throughout this period of\nhypotension.  He had a right femoral line placed on arrival\nto the Intensive Care Unit as well as a left arterial line\nplaced.  The patient was then started on Levophed at initial\ndose of 10 micrograms per minute as well as on Vasopressin as\ndose of 0.04 units per minute.  The patient was continued on\nthese pressors overnight for additional blood pressure\nsupport.  The patient also was treated with 2 liters of\nnormal saline run wide open for additional pressure support.\nThe patient was not responsive to the fluid resuscitation and\ntherefore did require the initiation of the pressors as\nmentioned.  The patient was continued on Levo, Flagyl and\nVancomycin was also started.\n\nThe patient's cardiac enzymes were cycled and were found to\nbe not elevated.  His CK and troponin were both within the\nnormal range.  In terms of rhythm, the patient was not in\natrial fibrillation on transfer to the Medical Intensive Care\nUnit and remained in sinus rhythm during his stay in the\nMedical Intensive Care Unit.\n\nAs mentioned on the evening of admission he was hypotensive\nwith blood pressure 60s/40s.  Given his pneumonia and\nsignificant bandemia as well as a history of shakes and\nchills prior to admission it was felt that the patient was\nseptic.  He was put on pressors for blood pressure support,\ngiven fluid 2 liters as mentioned and he was continued on\nbroad spectrum antibiotics.  From a pulmonary standpoint he\nwas treated for the pneumonia as mentioned.  The heparin drip\nwas discontinued, because the patient had no evidence of a PE\non CTA.  He was continued on Albuterol and Atrovent MDIs as\nwell as Flovent and Serevent given his history of chronic\nobstructive pulmonary disease.  His blood gas on admission to\nthe MCI was 737, 29, 77.  From a GI standpoint the patient\nwas continued on Zantac.  From a renal FEN standpoint, the\npatient was NPO.  His potassium was repleted and intravenous\nfluids for initial level of 3.1.  It was noted that his\ncreatinine increased to 1.4 from 0.6 on admission likely\nsecondary to poor perfusion in the setting of hypotension.\nHis creatinine was followed closely every day.  From an\ninfectious disease standpoint the patient's sputum was sent\nfor culture.  Preliminary data showed 4+ gram positive coxae\nin pairs and clusters as well as 1+ gram positive rods.  At\nthe time of this dictation there is no additional data on\nrespiratory culture.  The patient's temperature max on the\nmedical floor was 100.  He did not spike a temperature during\nhis stay in the Intensive Care Unit.\n\nOn the second day in the Intensive Care Unit on the morning\nfollowing his transfer the patient had remained on a\nnonrebreather with O2 sats in the high 90s overnight.  His\nLevophed was starting to be titrated down from 10 to 6 and\nultimately down to 3.  His Vasopressin was at 0.04 overnight\non the first evening in the Intensive Care Unit.  He also\nreceived q 2 hour nebulizers overnight.  Laboratory data on\nthe morning following his admission to the MICU included a\nwhite count increased to 11.2, hematocrit stable at 33.8,\nrepeat electrolytes showed a sodium of 134, potassium 6.1,\nchloride 106, bicarb 15, BUN 27, creatinine 1.5, glucose 103.\nCKs were 101, 84, and 82.  Troponin less then 0.3.  Calcium\n7.7, phos 3.4, magnesium 2.3.  Cortisol was sent off and came\nback at 14.  Coagulation studies revealed a PT of 14.5, PTT\n32.8, INR of 1.5.  Microbiology data still with a sputum gram\nstain 4+ gram positive coxae in pairs and clusters, 1+ gram\npositive rods.  No respiratory culture data as of yet.\n\nIn terms of the patient's pneumonia he was continued on Levo,\nFlagyl and Vancomycin.  White blood cell count was noted to\nbe up, however, the patient remained afebrile and his oxygen\nsaturation remained good on the nonrebreather.\n\nIn terms of his hypotension and sepsis, the decision was made\nto give the patient 1 liter of D5W with 3 amps of bicarb to\nbe repeated times two or three as needed for blood pressure\nsupport.  It was also decided to start the patient on high\ndose steroids Hydrocortisone 100 mg q 8 hours times three\ndoses.  There was discussion with the team whether the\npatient would be a candidate for activated protein C.  The\nconclusion was that the patient would possibly be a candidate\nand the team decided to wait to see how he did throughout the\nafternoon on the [**12-6**] before actually starting the\npatient on the activated protein C.\n\nIn terms of the patient's renal failure his creatinine was\n1.4 again the morning following his admission to the MICU.  A\nnotable increase from his baseline of .6.  It was felt that\nthis bump in his creatinine was due to hyperperfusion in the\nsetting of hypotension and the patient was given hydration as\nmentioned with 1 liter fluid boluses.  He was continued on\nLevofloxacin and Vancomycin at full dose as opposed to\nrenally dosing them given how sick he was.\n\nIn terms of his acid base status, the patient's bicarb was 16\non the morning following his admission to the MICU.  His\nlactate was up to 3.5.  His morning blood gas was 7.33, 34,\n87 indicating the patient was adequately compensating for his\nmetabolic acidosis.\n\nFrom a GI standpoint the patient was continued on Zantac.  In\nterms of prophylaxis the patient was put on subcutaneous\nheparin.  In terms of pain the patient was continued on\nToradol for his pleuritic chest pain.\n\nAt the time of this dictation, which is the [**12-7**] the\npatient has been off of his Levophed since 3:00 p.m. on [**2172-7-6**].  He has been approximately 24 hours off of Levophed\nand has been off Vasopressin for approximately a day and a\nhalf.  His laboratory data is much improved at the time of\nthis dictation.  His bicarb is up to 26.  His creatinine is\ndown to 0.9.  His blood pressure has been completely stable\nfollowing volume boluses, which have included a total of 2\nliters of D5W each with 3 amps of sodium bicarb.  He has had\nno temperature spikes and his O2 sats have been in high 90s\non a nonrebreather and ultimately on 4 liters nasal cannula.\n\nHis laboratory data is notable for a white blood cell count\nincrease to 17.9 in the setting of high dose steroids.\nHematocrit 30.9 in the setting of aggresive hydration.\nSodium 134, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, bicarb 26, BUN 18,\ncreatinine 0.9, glucose 109, calcium 7.8, magnesium 2.1, phos\n3.7, Cortisol 14, albumin 2.6.  The patient's microdata, only\nthe sputum gram stain is back with 4 positive gram positive\ncoxae in pairs and cultures.  Culture data is pending.  Blood\ncultures are no growth so far.\n\nFrom a pneumonia standpoint the patient is continued on broad\nspectrum antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Flagyl and\nVancomycin.  His respiratory status is significantly improved\nand he is on nasal cannula 4 liters.  He has not had any\ntemperature spikes during his stay in the Intensive Care\nUnit.\n\nFrom a hypotension/sepsis standpoint the patient's blood\npressures have been completely stable overnight as well as\nthe entire day on the [**7-6**].  He has been on pressors\nfor more then 24 hours.  His blood pressure is 99 to 122\nsystolic/65 to 80 diastolic.  The patient never received\nactivated protein C.  Instead he received broad spectrum\nantibiotics, fluid resuscitation and high dose steroids.\n\nFrom a renal standpoint his creatinine is trending down\nnicely to 0.9.  He is starting to mobilize his fluids and his\nrenal function appears to be improved.\n\nFrom an acid base standpoint it has lactated down today to\n1.9.  Arterial blood gas was 7.44, 51, 114, bicarb of 226\nyesterday afternoon and again this morning.  His acidosis has\nresoled.\n\nIn terms of hematologic, the patient's hematocrit is noted to\nbe 30.9 down from 33 in the setting of being approximately 3\nliters positive over the past 24 hours.  His admission\nhematocrit is noted to be 34, therefore we are checking iron\nstudies, LDH, haptoglobin, B-12 and folate levels.  The\npatient is without any known history of anemia.  His stools\nwill be guaiaced during the remainder of his hospital stay.\n\nIn terms of GI the patient was continued on Zantac.  His diet\nwill be advanced today as tolerated.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, the patient's\nelectrolytes were essentially within normal limits.  It was\nnoted that his albumin was decreased to 2.6, which seems\nsomewhat dramatic given that he has been without nutritional\nsupport for only two days.  It is now clear what his baseline\nalbumin is, but he looks like he is a well developed, well\nnourished gentleman and this may be something for his primary\ncare physician to follow up in the outpatient setting.\n\nIn terms of disposition the patient is full code.\n\nIn terms of access his right femoral and left arterial line\nwere both pulled without any adverse event on the [**2172-7-6**].  Communications have been with the patient's wife and\ndaughter who have been in the hospital for much of his\nhospital stay in the Intensive Care Unit.  The remainder of\nthe [**Hospital 228**] hospital stay including his discharge\nmedications will be dictated at the time of discharge.  He is\nbeing transferred to the medical floor on Vancomycin 1 gram q\n12 hours, Levofloxacin 500 mg po q day, Flagyl 500 mg po\nt.i.d., Zantac 50 mg po t.i.d., Albuterol and Atrovent\nnebulizers, Tylenol, Flovent, Serevent, Droperidol, aspirin\nand Prednisone 60 mg po q day.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            [**First Name8 (NamePattern2) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern1) **], M.D.  [**MD Number(1) 1379**]\n\nDictated By:[**Last Name (NamePattern1) 29450**]\nMEDQUIST36\n\nD:  [**2172-7-7**]  15:03\nT:  [**2172-7-7**]  15:26\nJOB#:  [**Job Number 42253**]",

He has had\nno temperature spikes and his O2 sats have been in high 90s\non a nonrebreather and ultimately on 4 liters nasal cannula.\n\nHis laboratory data is notable for a white blood cell count\nincrease to 17.9 in the setting of high dose steroids.\nHematocrit 30.9 in the setting of aggresive hydration.\nSodium 134, potassium 4.9, chloride 100, bicarb 26, BUN 18,\ncreatinine 0.9, glucose 109, calcium 7.8, magnesium 2.1, phos\n3.7, Cortisol 14, albumin 2.6.  The patient's microdata, only\nthe sputum gram stain is back with 4 positive gram positive\ncoxae in pairs and cultures.  Culture data is pending.  Blood\ncultures are no growth so far.\n\nFrom a pneumonia standpoint the patient is continued on broad\nspectrum antibiotics including Levofloxacin, Flagyl and\nVancomycin.  His respiratory status is significantly improved\nand he is on nasal cannula 4 liters.  He has not had any\ntemperature spikes during his stay in the Intensive Care\nUnit.\n\nFrom a hypotension/sepsis standpoint the patient's blood\npressures have been completely stable overnight as well as\nthe entire day on the [**7-6**].  He has been on pressors\nfor more then 24 hours.  His blood pressure is 99 to 122\nsystolic/65 to 80 diastolic.  The patient never received\nactivated protein C.  Instead he received broad spectrum\nantibiotics, fluid resuscitation and high dose steroids.\n\nFrom a renal standpoint his creatinine is trending down\nnicely to 0.9.  He is starting to mobilize his fluids and his\nrenal function appears to be improved.\n\nFrom an acid base standpoint it has lactated down today to\n1.9.

His diet\nwill be advanced today as tolerated.\n\nIn terms of fluid, electrolytes and nutrition, the patient's\nelectrolytes were essentially within normal limits.  It was\nnoted that his albumin was decreased to 2.6, which seems\nsomewhat dramatic given that he has been without nutritional\nsupport for only two days.  It is now clear what his baseline\nalbumin is, but he looks like he is a well developed, well\nnourished gentleman and this may be something for his primary\ncare physician to follow up in the outpatient setting.\n\nIn terms of disposition the patient is full code.\n\nIn terms of access his right femoral and left arterial line\nwere both pulled without any adverse event on the [**2172-7-6**].

In general, the patient was found lying in bed in no acute\ndistress.

He\nwas taken to the OR by Dr. [**First Name (STitle) **] [**Name (STitle) **] for orthotopic liver\ntransplant from standard brain dead donor, piggyback\ntechnique, portal vein to portal vein, with replaced left\nhepatic artery to hepatic artery branch patch anastomosis,\nbile duct to bile duct. Liver biopsy was done at that time.\nDr. [**First Name11 (Name Pattern1) **] [**Initial (NamePattern1) **] [**Last Name (NamePattern4) **] assisted. Estimated blood loss was 1\nliter. Please see operative report for further details. The\npatient remained hemodynamically stable throughout the case.\nThe patient was in stable condition, intubated and\ntransferred to the surgical intensive care unit for\npostoperative management. Postoperatively his LFTs decreased.\nHe was initially transfused with 2 units of packed red blood\ncells and 1 unit of platelets for hematocrit of 24.5, down\nfrom 32.4 and platelet count of 46. His vital signs were\nstable. His creatinine trended down slowly over the course of\nthe hospitalization to 1.8.\n\nImmediately postoperative, hepatic duplex was done. This\ndemonstrated all vessels in the liver being patent. A\nrecipient liver donor biopsy demonstrated established\ncirrhosis, stage 4 fibrosis. Please see pathology report for\nfurther details.\n\nNephrology consult was also obtained. Nephrology followed the\npatient in the immediate postoperative period, deferring\nhemodialysis with improvement of creatinine. He was extubated\non [**5-9**]. [**2117**]. Vital signs were stable.\n\nHe received the standard induction immunosuppression of\nCellCept 1 gram IV and 500 mg of Solu-Medrol. over the\nhospital course he continued on CellCept 1 gram PO b.i.d.\nwith a Solu-Medrol taper per protocol. His protocol steroid\ntaper was altered on postoperative day 10 for alteration of\nmental status which was initially noted in the surgical\nintensive care unit. The patient was confused.\n\nNeurology consult was obtained. He was inattentive. He was\nable to follow simple commands but these were sparse.\nSedation was minimized. It was felt the patient had a\nmetabolic derangement. He underwent an EEG to rule out\nseizure activity. No seizure activity was noted. A head CT\nwas done. This was also negative. No evidence of intracranial\nhemorrhage or mass effect was noted. Head MRI was done as\nwell with and without contrast. This demonstrated mild age\ninappropriate prominence of the sulci and ventricles. No\nacute infarct was noted. No mass effect or hydrocephalus was\nnoted. No abnormal enhancement was noted. Altered mental\nstatus was attributed to steroids and his prednisone was\ndecreased on postoperative day 10 to 15 mg. This was further\ndecreased to 10 mg on postoperative day 12 with improvement\nin the patient's mental status. His speech was more fluent.\nHe was more attentive and appropriate. Speech therapy consult\nwas obtained for concerns for altered mental status.\n\nIn summary, it was felt that the patient was experiencing a\ntoxic metabolic insult. He did not have an expressive or\nreceptive dysphagia. It was expected that the patient's\ncommunication abilities would return to baseline once medical\nissues were resolved. Given concerns for multifactorial\nconfusion secondary to increased creatinine and decreased\nsodium, he did undergo a hemodialysis briefly on [**2118-5-10**]. His sodium remained in the 127 range. He underwent\ndialysis again on [**2118-5-11**]. His sodium gradually\nimproved up to 132 with improvement in his creatinine to 1.9\nwithout dialysis.\n\nDue to poor PO intake, a nutrition consult was obtained. TPN\nwas started. [**Last Name (un) **] consult was obtained for management of\nhyperglycemia with improvement in mental status. The\npatient's oral intake improved and TPN was stopped. Physical\ntherapy worked with him initially recommending rehab but with\nimprovement in mental status. It was felt that the patient\nwould be safe to be discharged to home or to family member's\nhome. He was ambulatory in the hallway with supervision.\n\nThe patient experienced significant weight gain and pedal\nedema. This was treated with IV Lasix with improvement of\nedema. He was switched to Lasix 20 mg PO once daily. His\nweight dropped down to 100.3 from preoperative weight of\n114.1. He had two JP drains. These were removed and sutured\nand he experienced large volume output from the medial JP up\nto 2 liters per day. The JP drain was removed and the site\nsutured without further leaking his incision. A duplex of the\nabdomen was done on [**5-10**]. Patent hepatic and portal\nvessels were noted.  Bilateral lower extremity non-invasive\nstudies were done to evaluate edema. This was done on [**5-17**]. There was no evidence of DVT.\n\nOn [**5-18**], a post-pyloric bleeding tube was placed for\nconcerns that the patient would not be able to meet his\ncaloric intake need. Unfortunately the patient pulled out his\npost-pyloric feeding tube during the night. This was not\nreplaced given improved mental status. The patient was taking\nin at least 1800 Kcal the following day. Improved mental\nstatus was attributed to less steroids given.\n\nIn summary, the patient has been in stable condition,\nambulatory, tolerating a regular diet, his incision clips\nwere opened at the top of the incision in his left lateral\nside for leaking of serosanguineous drainage. Normal saline\ndamp to dry dressings were placed on the open areas b.i.d.\nHis liver function tests improved with an AST of 22, ALT of\n39, alkaline phosphatase 75, and total bilirubin of 0.8,\ncreatinine was down at 1.9. His hematocrit was stable in the\nrange of 25.2 to 27.3. Platelet count was 114. He continued\non immunosuppression with CellCept, prednisone and Prograf\nwhich was adjusted. This was titrated to 1 mg PO b.i.d for a\nlevel of 17.9.\n\nPlan was to send the patient home and not to rehab given\nimproved mental status.
